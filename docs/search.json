    "text": "I had the great opportunity to be part of the CERN-NASA working group “Infrastructure for Open Scholarship”. This working group was established following the 2023 CERN-NASA Summit “Accelerating the Adoption of Open Science”. As a result of the summit, a closing statement was published, outlining key areas of action for Open Science (Tananbaum et al. 2023).\nUnder the umbrella of the Open Research Funders Group (ORFG) and with financial support from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, key topics from the closing statement were further developed in working groups. One of these working groups focused on the advancement of open science infrastructures. Our working group has now published its results in the form of a set of recommendations for funding organizations (Arancio et al. 2024).\n\nExcerpt: “These recommendations for funders are accompanied by a set of principles for open infrastructure projects that complements the first set and aims to increase the quality of service provided to researchers and institutions. The group aims to emphasize that the principles for infrastructure initiatives do not have a prescriptive approach; instead, the goal should be to foster good practices in the field. This work intends to add and build on the corpus of work that has been undertaken globally in this area, some of which is referenced at the end of this document. As with any global framework, it will need to be regionally situated to ensure feasibility, efficacy, and sustainability in a diversity of contexts.”\nRecommendations for funding agencies based on a set of core principles were created. These principles encompass the topics of infrastructure in open scholarship policies, recognizing work, funding and support, capabilities, and transparency.\nMany thanks to Julieta Arancio for her effective and cooperative leadership of the working group, and to all participants for their openness.\nThis text – excluding quotes and otherwise labelled parts – is licensed under the CC BY 4.0 DEED.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nArancio, Julieta, Claudia Alarcón-López, Heinz Pampel, Sherry Lake, César Pallares, Esther Plomp, Miho Funamori, Tanja Friedrich, Emmy Tsang, and CERN-NASA Working Group \"Infrastructure for Open Scholarship\". 2024. “Science Funders: Commitments Towards Open Infrastructure,” June. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11444361.\n\n\nTananbaum, Greg, Chelle Gentemann, Kamran Naim, Christopher Marcum, Eric Emsellem, Eunice Mercado-Lara, Tanja Friedrich, et al. 2023. “Sowing the Seeds of Global Open Science Coordination,” November. https://doi.org/10.5281/ZENODO.10059154.\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{pampel2026,\n  author = {Pampel, Heinz},\n  title = {Recommendations for {Funding} {Organizations} on {Open}\n    {Science} {Infrastructures}},\n  date = {2026-06-11},\n  url = {https://infomgnt.org/posts/2026-06-11-recommendations-on-open-science-infrastructures/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nPampel, Heinz. 2026. “Recommendations for Funding Organizations on\nOpen Science Infrastructures.” June 11, 2026. https://infomgnt.org/posts/2026-06-11-recommendations-on-open-science-infrastructures/."
