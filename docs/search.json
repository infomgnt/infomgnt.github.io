    "section": "Presentations",
    "text": "Presentations\nOpen Science refers to efforts to implement various approaches to an open scientific practice (UNESCO 2021), aiming to promote transparent and inclusive science.\nAt the beginning of the event, three invited speakers – Dr. Lisa Kressin from the Leibniz Association, Dr. Stefan Skupien from the Berlin University Alliance (BUA), and Marcel Meistring from the Helmholtz Centre for Geosciences (GFZ) – presented different approaches taken by libraries and research institutions regarding Open Science.\nDr. Lisa Kressin (Leibniz Association) began her presentation by discussing the crucial role of infrastructures in promoting Open Science. She also emphasized the significance of self-governance in science for the development of Open Science. According to Kressin, Open Science must be developed in close collaboration with the scientific community rather than being purely politically motivated. However, she acknowledged that political engagement remains essential to advancing Open Science. She highlighted the potential of Open Science in strengthening research quality and reinforcing scientific transparency.\nFurthermore, she addressed the challenges of Open Science in practice. Due to varying knowledge cultures, it is impossible to impose uniform expectations on all stakeholders. She advocated for a practical approach to Open Science and stressed that funding remains a pressing issue. Kressin saw great potential in networking among scientific organizations to advance Open Science.\nDr. Stefan Skupien (BUA) also highlighted the importance of Open Science networks and collaboration, as many Open Science challenges require cooperative solutions. He underscored the potential of Open Science for research and introduced measures implemented by the BUA to promote it. Besides infrastructure development, Skupien focused on Open Science education and monitoring Open Science practices. These topics are also supported by the BUA through Open Science Fellowships.\nAnother initiative he mentioned was the establishment of Open Science Ambassadors, who serve as multipliers, spreading Open Science practices within the scientific community. He pointed out that the importance of Open Science varies across faculties within the BUA institutions. Therefore, the BUA aims to establish a reflective and discipline-specific approach to Open Science practices.\nIn the final presentation, Marcel Meistring from the GFZ Helmholtz Centre for Geosciences emphasized the importance of extensive consulting, research-support services, and support offerings in the field of publishing research results and research data management. He provided insights into the Open Science policy of the Helmholtz Association and the Open Science-related guidelines of the GFZ. He stressed that such policies serve as crucial guidelines in establishing an Open Science culture within scientific institutions.\nAdditionally, he explained the relevance of adhering to standards and utilizing persistent identifiers (PIDs) for providing, archiving, storing, publishing, and linking texts, research data, and research software. The use of standards and PIDs is crucial for the efficient implementation of Open Science. Meistring also presented current efforts by the Helmholtz Association to develop new quality indicators for research data and software publications. The goal is to adopt a broader perspective on research performance, recognizing published research data and software as valuable research outputs based on specific quality criteria."

    "text": "Discussion\nFollowing the presentations, the speakers engaged in a panel discussion, addressing questions regarding the further development of Open Science and potential fields of action, with additional contributions and questions from the audience. The discussion highlighted the necessity of further advancing Open Science in Germany. The panelists supported additional cross-organizational projects similar to the DEAL initiative.\nAs repeatedly emphasized in the presentations, intensified collaboration among various Open Science stakeholders is essential to effectively address challenges. However, difficulties arise due to funding constraints and a lack of institutional initiative. The monitoring of Open Science practices was identified as a crucial field of action for advancing Open Science. Additionally, promoting information literacy was deemed essential for the positive development of Open Science.\nThe discussion also touched upon the integration of Open Science principles into university curricula across all disciplines so that future researchers develop awareness of Open Science’s opportunities and challenges. In this context, the BUA Ambassadors initiative was praised for facilitating communication and exchange across different scientific domains, from which other institutions could also benefit."

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nIn summary, although Open Science has been a relevant topic in Germany for several years, the scientific community still does not allocate it sufficient attention and significance. Enhanced training in the form of workshops and advisory services on Open Science, as well as adequate resources, are crucial for further advancing Open Science in Germany. In this regard, sustainable funding, stronger collaboration among stakeholders, increased resource allocation in infrastructures, and greater public involvement are needed.\nGiven the budgetary and geopolitical challenges for open and networked science, the speakers expressed some concerns about future developments. Nevertheless, they emphasized the importance of embedding and promoting Open Science in a cooperative and international context to align its progress with UNESCO recommendations."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In a time when research data is increasingly at the heart of research integrity, discussions about data sharing, openness, and reusability have gained prominence. Yet, the ethical complexities surrounding research data—who collects it, how it is used, and whose interests it serves—are often sidelined. The Critical Data Discourses lecture series seeks to shift the focus from purely technical concerns to broader ethical, social, and political reflections on data.\nDiscussions about data in research are often dominated by principles like FAIR (Wilkinson et al. 2016), which aim to standardize and optimize the findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability of research data. While these principles are important, they do not fully capture the ethical dimensions of data collection and use. Questions of fairness, responsibility, power dynamics, and care work in data practices are not covered by these principles.\n\nAt the same time, international discussions have introduced complementary frameworks, such as the CARE principles (Carroll et al. 2020)—developed from Indigenous governance perspectives—which emphasize the social and relational aspects of data. These principles highlight how data is not just a neutral resource but deeply intertwined with historical, social, and ethical considerations.\nWith this lecture series, we aim to bring together data professionals and critical scholars to examine the evolving landscape of data ethics and adjacent questions about data politics and data justice. Through a series of expert talks, we are exploring issues that are often missing from mainstream research data discussions, such as:\n\nThe ethics of data collection and the ethical considerations behind it\nThe role of domain-specific ethical considerations in fields like humanities, medicine, and AI research\nThe limitations of existing data frameworks and their unintended consequences\nData gaps and missing data—what is left out of research and why\nThe influence of AI and automation on knowledge production and discrimination\nThe impact of historical injustices on contemporary data practices\n\nOur motivation for organizing this series stems from a shared interest in rethinking data practices beyond efficiency and compliance, and centering on issues of ethics, justice, transparency, and responsibility. More information is available on our website.\nAfter a successful launch with over 100 participants in our first session, we are excited to continue the discussions in our upcoming talks on data ethics, AI, and power structures in research data.\nHere is a look at what’s next (in German):\n\nSession 3: 04.03.2025, 14-16 Uhr Ethik des Sammelns\nThe Dark Side of DNA: Exposing the Ethical Lapses That Threaten Human Genetics\nVortragender: Yves Moreau, University of Leuven, Belgium\nUnborn digital.

    "section": "",
    "text": "In recent years, transformative agreements (TAs) have become a go-to strategy for publishers and research performing organizations aiming to open up access to research (Farley et al. 2021). These agreements promise to bridge traditional subscription-based journal models to an Open Access (OA) future (Borrego, Anglada, and Abadal 2021). But are they delivering on that promise? In this new pre-print, my colleagues W. Benedikt Schmal, Ulrich Herb and I did a thorough analysis of 1,075 TAs in order to get the most complete picture possible with the available data.\nRothfritz, L., Schmal, W. B., & Herb, U. (2024). Trapped in Transformative Agreements? A Multifaceted Analysis of &gt;1,000 Contracts. arXiv. https://doi.org/10.48550/ARXIV.2409.20224\n\nWhat We Did: A Blend of Data Crunching and Thematic Analysis\nTo understand TAs better, we gathered data from a unique source: the ESAC Initiative, which tracks over 1,000 transformative agreements. This data, alongside additional contract details we scraped, allowed us to go beyond basic summaries. We analyzed both numbers and narratives, mixing quantitative approaches like regression analysis with qualitative coding of free-text answers collected by ESAC through their registry form. This dual approach helped us capture not only the frequency and size of agreements but also the subjective experiences libraries shared.\n\n\nKey Findings: Are Libraries Trapped?\nOne of our core findings is that TAs may not just be a stepping stone toward full OA but could be trapping libraries in hybrid models indefinitely. Here’s what stood out:\n\nDominance of Big Publishers: We found that a small number of publishers, mainly Elsevier, Springer Nature, and Wiley, dominate these agreements. These “Big 3” often secure longer contracts with more favorable terms for themselves, locking libraries into longer commitments and substantial costs.\nRising Costs, Limited Flexibility: While TAs have led to more OA articles, they don’t always reduce costs for libraries. In fact, we discovered that the larger the initial TA contract, the more likely it is to be renewed, creating a cycle of dependency. Libraries often face increased administrative burdens and costs without the savings they expected.\nCapped vs. Uncapped Contracts: Contracts come in two flavors—capped (with a limit on the number of OA articles) and uncapped. Uncapped contracts are generally preferred, as they reduce the risk of libraries exceeding their article limit and facing additional charges. However, even uncapped contracts often exclude fully OA journals, limiting the growth of the OA movement.\nWorkflow Wins and Woes: One bright spot is that many libraries reported improvements in their workflows under TAs, especially where automated tools like CCC RightsLink and others and real-time dashboards were used. Yet, issues remain—many libraries still struggle with complex, manual workflows and limited monitoring capabilities.\nMixed Feelings on Sustainability: Libraries are split on the sustainability of TAs. While some view them as a positive, affordable transition tool, others worry about long-term financial strain, especially as publishers maintain their market power and high fees.\n\n\n\nFinal Thoughts: A Double-Edged Sword?\nOur analysis suggests that while TAs have increased the number of OA articles, they might also be cementing the dominance of large publishers and creating financial traps for libraries. Rather than acting as a bridge to a fully OA landscape, TAs may become a permanent fixture, with academic institutions continually caught in a cycle of payments and negotiations (Fenter 2022; Jahn 2024; Schmal 2024).\nIt will be interesting to see how the scientific community and libraries, in their negotiations with publishers, achieve progress in contract development and how these will fit into the future Open Access mix, including strategies for community-led publishing. A particularly noteworthy case is Sweden, where the Bibsam Consortium recommends to no longer sign any TAs for hybrid journals.\nReplication code, scripts, and data used for this study are publicly available on Zenodo: https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.13453629.\nFurther information about the research group can be found on our official website.\nThis text – excluding quotes and otherwise labelled parts – is licensed under the CC BY 4.0 DEED.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBorrego, Ángel, Lluís Anglada, and Ernest Abadal. 2021. “Transformative Agreements: Do They Pave the Way to Open Access?” Learned Publishing 34 (2): 216–32. https://doi.org/10.1002/leap.1347.\n\n\nFarley, Ashley, Allison Langham-Putrow, Elisabeth Shook, Leila Belle Sterman, and Megan Wacha. 2021. “Transformative Agreements: Six Myths, Busted.” College & Research Libraries News, July. https://doi.org/10.5860/crln.82.7.298.\n\n\nFenter, Frederick. 2022. “It Is Not Transformation If Nothing Changes.” Frontiers.\n\n\nJahn, Najko. 2024. “How Open Are Hybrid Journals Included in Transformative Agreements?” arXiv. https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2402.18255.\n\n\nSchmal, W.

    "text": "This week marks the fifteenth annual International Open Access Week. Since 2010, the week has provided a platform to discuss the state and challenges of open access to scientific knowledge. While the early years focused on access to scientific articles (“Open Access Week” 2024), this year’s activities increasingly address other aspects of Open Science.\nUniversities, research labs, and libraries worldwide are participating in the week with various activities. For Germany, a list of events can be found on the website open-access.network. Since 2012, a theme has been chosen for the week each year. This year’s theme is “Community over Commercialization” (Week n.d.).\nOur research group is also participating in this year’s Open Access Week. On Monday, October 21, 2024, from 2:00 PM to 3:30 PM (CET), we are organizing a panel in collaboration with the Open-Access-Büro Berlin titled “Open Access Monitoring – Opportunities and Challenges for Open Science.” The event will be held online in German. Registration is available on the Open-Access-Büro Berlin website.\n\nAbstract (Kindling and Pampel 2024, translation by me)\nTo track the progress of the transformation to Open Access, indicators such as publication numbers or publication costs are often considered. Open data plays a key role in this. With OpenAlex (Priem, Piwowar, and Orr 2022) and the accompanying Barcelona Declaration on Open Research Information (“Barcelona Declaration on Open Research Information” n.d.), the Open Access community is well on its way to ensuring that monitoring is not left solely to commercial providers. At the same time, new challenges arise in monitoring, such as considering more advanced principles of Open Science in the context of community-led Open Access publishing or including other publication formats and practices. These questions include:\n\nHow can we track the growing number of community-led initiatives and their publication and funding models without simply counting the quantitative output of journals and articles?\nHow can institutions make their efforts to build open publication infrastructures more visible?\nHow can the implementation of strategies be made visible not only in terms of outcomes at a given point in time but also in terms of process?\nHow much influence do the things we measure and define have on the path we take in the Open Access transformation?\n\nI look forward to moderating the discussions with Irene Barbers (Forschungszentrum Jülich), Najko Jahn (University of Göttingen), Jochen Johannsen (RWTH Aachen), and Maxi Kindling (Open-Access-Büro Berlin).\nThe event is also part of the “Quo Vadis Open Science in Berlin and Brandenburg 2024/25” series, which addresses the state and perspectives of Open Science in Berlin and Brandenburg.\nFurther information about the research group can be found on our official website.\nThis text – excluding quotes and otherwise labelled parts – is licensed under the CC BY 4.0 DEED.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n“Barcelona Declaration on Open Research Information.” n.d.

    "section": "",
    "text": "We are excited to announce the launch of our new project, “Infra Wiss Blogs - Kooperative Informationsinfrastruktur für wissenschaftliche Blogs” funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG 2023).\nBlogs have become an indispensable component of digital science communication, serving as a platform for scholarly communication, a diary for documenting research findings in the context of open science, or a showcase for communicating scientific findings to the general public. However, challenges for scholarly blogs arise from unresolved issues pertaining to the permanent preservation of blog posts and the frequent lack of evidence in library records, hindering the sustainability of this publication type (Pampel and Rothfritz 2024).\nThe project Infra Wiss Blogs aims to support blogging researchers and information infrastructure institutions in identifying potential solutions for ensuring the long-term accessibility of scholarly blogs in Germany. To this end, the project facilitates and moderates a discussion process to develop a distributed system for a permanent accessibility and storage solution for scholarly blogs. Given the complexity and scope of this endeavor the development of such an information system for research requires collaborative efforts (Pampel and Rothfritz 2024).\nTo foster collaboration and promote stakeholder networking, the project will organize communication forums on this topic, bringing together science and infrastructure. This approach will facilitate coordination among actors, processes, and standards. The process should lead to the development of a distributed, organizational, technological, and cooperatively supported infrastructure that ensures the permanent accessibility of scholarly blogs. Furthermore, the project will be accompanied by a socio-technical perspective of information science (Pampel and Rothfritz 2024).\nFor further details about the project, please refer to the project proposal (Pampel and Rothfritz 2024). Additionally, we are excited to host a workshop at this year’s Open-Access-Tage in Cologne. Together with our colleagues Evin Dalkilic from Verfassungsblog, Martin Fenner from Front Matter, and Ulrike Stockhausen from the Max Weber Stiftung, we will present the workshop “Wissenschaftsblogs als Blaupause für das wissenschaftsgeleitete Open-Access-Publizieren” and discuss aspects and solutions for providing the continuous accessibility of scholarly blogs (GESIS - Leibniz-Institute for the Social Sciences et al. 2024).\nFurthermore we will be hosting the workshop “Vernetzungsworkshop Infra Wiss Blogs” on December 6th at the Einstein Center Digital Future, bringing together bloggers and stakeholders from information infrastructure facilities. At the workshop we will present a first insight into the German scholarly blogs and share experiences from both bloggers as well as information infrastructure experts.\nWe will provide updates on current activities and project outputs on the projects blog, that will be published soon, and through the Infra Wiss Blogs mailing list.\nFurther information about the research group can be found on our official website.\nThis text – excluding quotes and otherwise labeled parts – is licensed under the CC BY 4.0 DEED.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nDFG. 2023. “Förderprogramm „Verantwortung Für Informations-Infrastrukturen Gemeinsam Organisieren“ (VIGO).” https://www.dfg.de/de/foerderung/foerdermoeglichkeiten/programme/infrastruktur/lis/lis-foerderangebote/vigo.\n\n\nGESIS - Leibniz-Institute for the Social Sciences, Catholic University of Applied Sciences of North Rhine – Westphalia, TH Köln - University of Applied Sciences, University of Cologne: University and City Library of Cologne, and German National Library of Medicine. 2024. “Open-Access-Tage 2024.” Technische Informationsbibliothek (TIB). https://doi.org/10.25798/S2SD-VN02.\n\n\nPampel, Heinz, and Laura Rothfritz. 2024. “Kooperative Informationsinfrastruktur Für Wissenschaftliche Blogs (Infra Wiss Blogs).” Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13234482.\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{ochsner2024,\n  author = {Ochsner, Catharina and Pampel, Heinz},\n  title = {Project Launch: {Infra} {Wiss} {Blogs} - {Ensuring}\n    {Permanent} {Access} to {Scholarly} {Blogs}},\n  date = {2024-09-05},\n  url = {https://doi.org/10.59350/sea3s-tc489},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nOchsner, Catharina, and Heinz Pampel. 2024. “Project Launch: Infra\nWiss Blogs - Ensuring Permanent Access to Scholarly Blogs.”\nSeptember 5, 2024. https://doi.org/10.59350/sea3s-tc489."

    "text": "Regardless of whether one is just starting out or has already arrived in the community, as young librarians and information scientists, there are many interesting fields and new developments. For example, there are discussions about the diverse potential of artificial intelligence in library environments, the currently developing discussion on how to handle library collections with a colonial history and context, how to incorporate comics into bibliographic data sets, or the evaluation of the major transformative agreements in Germany - just to name a few. But how can one experience all this without having to visit completely different events and locations? For instance, by attending Bibliocon.\nThis year’s 112th Bibliocon took place in Hamburg and welcomed more than 4,000 guests from 30 countries (BuB) between June 4th and 7th 2024. Over three days, there were 240 events that covered every imaginable topic in the field of library and information science (Bibliocon Program). The presentations were organized by overarching theme areas, such as library-related topics, open-access-related topics, information science-related topics, etc. In addition, there were presentations from a wide range of companies, such as publishers like Elsevier, Springer Nature or service providers like Clarivate.\nAmong the many attendees were also two student employees from the Information Management department at the Berlin School for Library and Information Science (IBI) at Humboldt University Berlin who had the great opportunity to attend the congress. As “first-timers”, our attendance was naturally about collecting as many interesting experiences as possible - both in terms of information management to enrich our work in the research group and also in our own areas of interest. To coordinate this beforehand, we could even use an app provided by the event and of course also refer to a printed program with a detailed schedule.\nAlongside an extremely enthusiastic and friendly staff, who gave us some useful tips for orientation in the massive Congress Center Hamburg (CCH), we would like to highlight the very accommodating first-timer event of the Professional Association of Information and Libraries (BIB - Berufsverband Information Bibliothek). For young trainees and students in the library sector, there was a lot of material and tips for the trade fair, as well as general guidance for navigating the profession.\n\nUnfortunately, we had to miss out on attending some events due to time overlaps with similar events or miscalculations regarding expected attendance numbers, which often was quite regrettable. Although there was a seated streaming offer on site, not all overcrowded events were streamed or could be streamed frequently. This was particularly evident at the AI panels, where there was high demand for events that focused on their practical applications and assistance functions.\nAlthough the app unfortunately only catered to iOS users, Android users could still use a browser version (not optimal but okay), and despite having very few power outlets and corresponding charging options, Bibliocon provided a spacious and practical working area. However, it must be noted that food and drink prices were not student-friendly at all.\nThe general political discussion and development also found its way onto Bibliocon. For example, there was an interesting event about Czech libraries that dealt with their positioning in political debates in the country. (Petrak 2024) Three projects from different libraries were presented that had caused a stir with events during Pride Month and a debate event on same-sex marriage.\nTwo libraries in Brno and Usti nad Labem were presented as examples of cooperation with local associations to organize Pride Month events. These included readings by drag queens for parents and children as well as an installation of a themed corner for young people featuring a “Rainbow Mailbox” similar to a complaint box where young people can anonymously express their fears, worries, or general their feelings. The drag queen readings sparked both enthusiasm and opposition in both cities; conservative parties from the regions even mobilized people to disrupt these events. What stood out about this event was how strongly they adapted their plans to suit local circumstances while also reflecting on failed approaches – such as how attention shifted mainly towards those opposed during debates divided into two evenings based on position due to higher attendance numbers among those opposing it. At the same time, speakers were open to suggestions from outside during discussions so they could incorporate them into future planning.\nSeveral panels were dedicated to the historical reevaluation of colonialism and practical conclusions for today’s work. In addition to a stimulating podium discussion, “Challenges of Cultural Heritage from Colonial Contexts in Libraries” (Müller et al. 2024) et al., with literature and cultural scientist Albert Gouaffo (University of Dschang), who was cut in from Cameroon, library representatives at the State Library in Berlin (Staatsbibliothek Berlin) had organized a workshop for discussing a guide for handling these library collections with sensitivity (Schmid and Scheibe 2024).\nAs student employees, we were naturally also interested in the various company presentations at the fair. However, there was only limited feedback after visiting several stands. We could still listen to an Elsevier presentation, where Max Vögler presented an international interview study on challenges for universities and research funding organizations, particularly research evaluation, research assessment, and the concept of the “4th Generation University”.\nVarious projects by or with involvement by the research and teaching group of Information Management (IBI) were also represented in this year’s Bibliocon program. In addition to the Hands-On Lab “Scenarios for further development of open-access repositories”(“Szenarien für die Weiterentwicklung von Open-Access-Repositorien”) (Beucke et al. 2024) in cooperation with DINI AG Elektronisches Publizieren (DINI working group Electronic Publishing), the research project “Professionalization of OAR Infrastructure in Germany” (Pampel et al. 2024) was able to present itself and initial results on analyzing challenges for developing “Next Generation Repositories”.\nJoshua Shelly (UB Potsdam) presented a study from Transform2Open (Ferguson et al. 2024) on “Process Optimization of Open Access Workflows in Academic Libraries”, which demonstrated that OA workflows need to be designed holistically and integrated into daily operations as well as various institutional departments to be sustainable, practice-oriented, and optimized. The study was developed with contributions from partner institutions such as Forschungszentrum Jülich, the Helmholtz Open Science Office, and the University of Potsdam. Additionally, the Hands-on Lab “Central Publication Cost Recording: When a Few Bucks Come Together in Science”(“Zentrale Publikationskostenerfassung: Wenn ein paar Kröten in der Wissenschaft zusammenkommen”) (Stein et al. 2024) highlighted the possibilities repositories offer for central publication cost recording. Cornelia Lang (UB Regensburg) and Lisa-Marie Stein (openCost) provided a very detailed discussion on workflow issues, centralization, and repository software. Another interesting contribution was made by Najko Jahn (SUB Göttingen), who discussed the status and development of the Open Access transformation in hybrid journals (Jahn 2024). Among other things, he introduced the Hybrid Open Access Dashboard HOAD and compared developments in the German scientific landscape with those in the international arena. Finally, we agreed that attending Bibliocon was a great enrichment and can only recommend the conference to interested students. There are many new contents and perspectives to discover that are not covered in everyday studies. However, it should be noted that the ticket, like many other conferences, is not particularly cheap, although there is a discount for students and early bookers. Therefore, it is worthwhile to book as early as possible and in conjunction with a job. In any case, the experiences are definitely worth it.\nFurther information about the research group can be found on our official website.\nThis text – excluding quotes and otherwise labelled parts – is licensed under the CC BY 4.0 DEED.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBeucke, Daniel, Isabella Meinecke, Heinz Pampel, and Marcel Wrzesinski. 2024. “Research Group Information Management @ Humboldt-Universität Zu Berlin - Report on the Hands-on Lab ‘Scenarios for the Development of Open Access Repositories’ at the 112th BiblioCon.

    "section": "",
    "text": "In the beginning of June 2024, Nature reported on the Japanese Ministry of Education’s plan to invest 10 billion yen in expanding institutional Open Access Repositories (Singh Chawla 2024). This initiative provides a good opportunity to discuss the future of Open Access Repositories at the https://2024.bibliocon.de/.\nIn collaboration with the project “Professionalization of the Open Access Repositories Infrastructure in Germany” (Pro OAR DE) (Pampel and Rothfritz 2023), funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), the Electronic Publishing Working Group (AG E-Pub) of the German Initiative for Networked Information (DINI) organized a Hands-On Lab titled “Scenarios for the Development of Open Access Repositories” on June 6, 2024, during the 112th BiblioCon. The goal was to develop scenarios for the future orientation of institutional Open Access repositories with participants from academia, libraries, and other information infrastructures.\nThe methodological approach for this event was based on the Delphi concept (Häder 2014), (Niederberger and Renn 2019). Participants were asked to evaluate predefined statements on repositories in two consecutive rounds. This method aimed to reach a consensus on specific scenarios for the future of repositories. About 30 people participated in the lab and were divided into groups of four which simultaneously discussed the scenarios. The discussions were based on eight statements that were prepared by the organizers in advance and addressed aspects of the development of Open Access repositories.\nFirst, each group assessed the eight statements with the aim of coming to a consensus about the topic. For example, participants were asked to discuss the following proposition: “Preprints play an important role in the informational expansion of repositories.” Each group needed to develop a joint position on this and the other seven statements, by rating them on a scale from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree.”\nIn the following round, each group further explored three statements and discussed strategies and concrete measures to address the issues raised in each statements. The goal was to develop practical approaches to the topics, based on a shared understanding of the statements, focusing on the joint discussion of solution strategies.\n\nLessons Learned\nThe chosen method did not allow for in-depth examination and was not representative, but it enabled a focused and useful discussion of current issues facing institutional repositories. Reaching a consensus was challenging, as interpretations of the statements varied significantly among participants, and evaluations differed depending on perspectives and group compositions.\nFor the following three statements, approval ratings were identified in all four groups (grouped as “somewhat agree” and “strongly agree”):\n\nRepositories’ user interfaces should become more intuitive and modern.\nText and data repositories should intensify their exchange with each other.\nRepositories should take more measures to increase the visibility of their content.\n\nIn the second round, the following implementation strategies were discussed for these three statements:\nRepositories’ user interfaces should become more intuitive and modern:\n\nOffer multilingual user interfaces that support languages beyond German and English.\nSimplify uploads through data import via API integration (e.g., DOI queries via Crossref).\nEliminate mandatory fields that researchers must fill out.\nEnsure responsiveness on various devices.\n\nText and data repositories should intensify their exchange with each other:\n\nEnsure automatic data flows between research data repositories and institutional Open Access repositories.\nSimplify uploads through data import via API integration (e.g., DOI queries via Crossref).\nEvaluate local architecture to determine whether a generic repository for all object types or different repositories for each publication type is more practical.\n\nRepositories should take more measures to increase the visibility of their content:\n\nDisplay bibliographic data in the OPAC or Discovery System.\nIndex bibliographic data in search services .\nActively implement search engine optimization measures.\nEnable automated data flows via persistent identifiers.\n\nThe authors thank the participants for their open discussions and for sharing their experiences on strategies to further professionalize Open Access repositories.\nThe results will also be used for the further development of the DINI Certificate for Open-Access Publication Services and in the ongoing work of the Pro OAR DE project. Workshops on some aspects will be held in the further course of the Pro OAR DE project.\nFurther information about the research group can be found on our official website.\nThis text – excluding quotes and otherwise labeled parts – is licensed under the CC BY 4.0 DEED. \n\nPhoto Credit: Melanie Seltmann, licensed under the CC BY 4.0 DEED.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nHäder, Michael. 2014.

    "section": "",
    "text": "We are excited to announce the launch of our new project, “Data Practices for Shaping Open Access Transformation - Analysis, Recommendation, Training & Networking - OA Datenpraxis” funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation).\nTogether with our colleagues at the Helmholtz Open Science Office and the Scholarly Communication Analytics Team at the Lower Saxony State and University Library Göttingen (SUB), we, the research group Information Management at the Berlin School of Library and Information Science (IBI), will work towards strengthening structures for the use of data on the open access transformation at research institutions in Germany.\nThe project supports practitioners in research administration, libraries and other service institutions in professionalizing their data practices through various activities. As a first step, the team at IBI will conduct a comprehensive study on how research institutions handle publication costs. Our research will build on existing research and previous work of the project partners. Our goal is to get a better understanding of current practices and challenges associated with managing data on Open Access publications and associated costs.\nIn strengthening the abilities of research institutions to leverage data to monitor publication output and associated costs, we are addressing some of the recommendations of the German Council of Science and Humanities for fostering the Open Access transformation in Germany (Wissenschaftsrat 2022). Additional information about the project and its goals can be found in the project proposal (in German) (Pampel et al. 2024).\nAt this year’s Open-Access-Tage in Cologne, we are organizing a workshop with Open-Access-Büro Berlin, Vernetzungs- und Kompetenzstelle Open Access Brandenburg and Open Access Monitor at Forschungszentrum Jülich (FZJ). If you are interested in Open Access reporting and are attending, please feel free to approach us at the conference or contact us via email.\nWe will report on current activities and project outputs on the project website and Mastodon.\n\nFurther information about the research group can be found on our official website.\nThis text – excluding quotes and otherwise labeled parts – is licensed under the CC BY 4.0 DEED.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nPampel, Heinz, Najko Jahn, Roland Bertelmann, Wolfram Horstmann, Laura Rothfritz, Lea Maria Ferguson, Birgit Schmidt, and Anna Stisser. 2024. “Datenpraxis Zur Gestaltung Der Open-Access-Transformation - Analyse, Empfehlung, Training & Vernetzung (OA Datenpraxis).” https://doi.org/10.5281/ZENODO.10794298.\n\n\nWissenschaftsrat. 2022. “Empfehlungen Zur Transformation Des Wissenschaftlichen Publizierens Zu Open Access.” https://doi.org/10.57674/FYRC-VB61.\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{strecker2024,\n  author = {Strecker, Dorothea and Pampel, Heinz},\n  title = {Project Launch: {OA} {Datenpraxis-} {Data} {Practices} for\n    {Shaping} the {Open} {Access} {Transformation}},\n  date = {2024-06-19},\n  url = {https://doi.org/10.59350/es0dc-vhb02},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nStrecker, Dorothea, and Heinz Pampel. 2024. “Project Launch: OA\nDatenpraxis- Data Practices for Shaping the Open Access\nTransformation.” June 19, 2024. https://doi.org/10.59350/es0dc-vhb02."

    "title": "Research Data Publications Between Dynamism and Persistence - Insights from the #PIDsBUA Workshop",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Research is inherently dynamic, leading to equally dynamic data. This dynamic nature of research data raises numerous questions for professionals in information management at research institutions, libraries, and computing centers. Despite the conceptual establishment of research data citation through persistent identifiers (PIDs) in some communities, practical challenges remain. This is the case within the infrastructure of repositories and journals, particularly regarding their practices, guidelines, and standards.\nOur team at the Research Group Information Management at the Berlin School of Library and Information Science is dedicated to understanding research data versioning as part of information management processes at research-performing organizations (RPOs). With the project “PID Reference Model for Research Data Versioning” (#PIDsBUA) funded by the “Advancing Research Quality and Value” fellowship program of the Berlin University Alliance (BUA), we address questions of dynamism and persistence in the context of the persistent identification of research data.\nOur project benefits from the expertise of Jens Klump, Senior Principal Research Officer at Australia’s national science agency CSIRO, who is working as a BUA Fellow with our research group. Jens has extensive experience in this field, including contributions to the Research Data Alliance (RDA) Data Versioning Working Group (Klump et al. 2020), (Klump et al. 2021).\nOne question touching on the tension between the dynamic nature of data and the need for persistence on the side of infrastructures that can arise when dynamic research data is published in repositories is how these datasets should be recorded in publication management and research information documentation. Ensuring proper attribution of research performance for publishing dynamic datasets while addressing practical recording issues is a central concern of our project.\n\nTo facilitate a broad discussion with experts from academia, infrastructure, and administration, and to enhance the transfer of our work within Berlin’s research landscape, we hosted a workshop on June 28, 2024, at the Einstein Center Digital Future (ECDF) in Berlin. The event attracted around 40 experts from diverse scientific domains.\nAfter an introductory session, discussions focused on four key themes and the associated questions:\n\nRevision and Release:\n\nWhen do we differentiate between a revision and a release in research data management?\n\nTime Series and Dynamic Data:\n\nHow can we address the unique characteristics of time series and dynamic data in research data management?\n\nGranularity and Collections:\n\nHow does versioning support recording the provenance of an object?\n\nProvenance, Citation, and Metadata:\n\nHow should we handle provenance, citation, and metadata in the context of research data versioning?\n\n\nThese themes were discussed within the framework of the RDA’s work.\nLessons Learned\nIn a fruitful and lively discussion, we identified the following points\n\nRevision and Release:\n\nWhile many technological aspects of versioning are clear, definitional and coordination activities are still crucial. Establishing whether a change is a revision or a release requires developing conventions within user groups.\n\nTime Series and Dynamic Data:\n\nDifferent practices are necessary depending on the use case, such as ensuring traceability or allowing ongoing machine access to a dataset. Solutions should be tailored to the specific user groups.\n\nGranularity and Collections:\n\nProfessional requirements significantly influence granularity and collections, posing challenges for infrastructures that organize and provide access to these collections.\n\nProvenance, Citation, and Metadata:\n\nDiscussions highlighted the importance of metadata and evolving citation practices in facilitating dataset provenance. These practices are often shaped by disciplinary publication cultures and require infrastructure-level support.\n\n\nWe thank all participants for their enthusiasm and engaging discussions. The workshop offered a great platform for cross-institutional and cross-disciplinary dialogue, promoting valuable mutual learning.\nMany thanks to the BUA for their funding and to the ECDF for their hospitality.\nA workshop report in German is available (Klump 2024).

    "title": "Perspectives on the future of community-driven Open Access publishing",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The conversation about advancing the open access transformation has been revitalized by the “Council Conclusions on High-Quality, Transparent, Open, Trustworthy, and Equitable Scholarly Publishing” issued by the EU Science Ministries in May 2023 (Council of the European Union 2023).\nIn September 2023, we organized the conference “Community-Driven Open Access Publishing” as a satellite event of the Open Access Days 2023 (Bibliotheks- und Informationswissenschaft 2023).\nDuring the conference, we discussed ten statements on the future of community-driven open access publishing. An initial version of the statements had been drafted in German by the conference program committee between early March 2023 and the end of July 2023. Attendees had the opportunity to comment on these theses on the PubPub platform during the conference (Pampel et al. 2023). \nThe feedback collected on PubPub, at the conference, and on social media formed the basis for revising the statements, of which an updated version was published in April 2024 (Pampel, Bargheer, Bertelmann, Kaden, Wrzesinski, et al. 2024).\n\nTogether with Margo Bargheer, Roland Bertelmann, Ben Kaden, Maxi Kindling, and Dagmar Schobert, we have since then published an article in German about the development of the statements in the journal Bibliothek Forschung und Praxis (Pampel, Bargheer, Bertelmann, Kaden, Kindling, et al. 2024).\nTo mark the publication of the ten statements and also to broaden the conversation, this blog post documents the core elements in English: \n1. Bridging the strategic gap\nCommunity-driven publication infrastructures need backing from a comprehensive, large-scale strategy from research funding and infrastructure organizations. Only a high-profile initiative can ensure the necessary scientific policy support and financial commitment, thereby strengthening digital sovereignty in science.\n2. Acknowledging diversity in funding and business models\nCommunity-driven publication infrastructures require varied funding and business models tailored to the specific requirements of each (subject) community. This process should be guided by maximum transparency on costs and service portfolio.\n3. Strengthening libraries as publication service providers\nCommunity-driven publication infrastructures require a professional operation. Academic libraries, with their established services, expertise, and strong networks, are well-positioned to serve as active publication service providers for scholarly communities. Therefore, publication infrastructures within libraries should be systematically expanded.\n4. Ensuring quality, applying standards\nCommunity-driven publication infrastructures such as journals are responsible for maintaining the content quality of publications. This should be ensured using recognized quality assurance procedures that align with good scientific practice. Formal and technical quality assurance should be implemented by applying open publishing standards for both publications and processes.\n5. Strengthening collaboration with disciplinary communities\nCommunity-driven publication infrastructures need a strong foundation within scholarly subject communities and their organizational structures, such as learned societies. Collaboration should be participatory while allowing the publication infrastructures to remain autonomous. Libraries should engage more closely with subject communities and proactively shape services for the research community.\n6. Promoting experiments and innovation\nCommunity-driven publication infrastructures have the potential to shape innovations in scholarly publishing. Experimentation with new publication formats, further development of processes and standards, and exploration of new collaborative approaches should be encouraged.\n7. Ensuring sustainability\nCommunity-driven publication infrastructures require sustainable funding and business models. \nTo achieve this, a clear organizational integration is needed, a precisely defined mission and scope statement is essential, and funding organizations should express their commitment. Furthermore, the technical and legal sustainability of the infrastructures and their publications must be promoted by using open standards and open licenses.\n8. Orienting infrastructures towards the common good\nCommunity-driven publication infrastructures should focus on the common good and base their activities on the principles and values of the UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science (UNESCO 2021).\n9. Entering new collaborations\nCommunity-driven publication infrastructures should explore innovative collaboration models, operate across institutional and national boundaries, and aim to increase their visibility and that of their publications. Collaborations with external service providers can be advantageous, provided that governance remains aligned with scholarly interests.\n10. Implementing Open Science\nCommunity-driven publication infrastructures should enable the publication of texts, data, software, and other resources, and support the recognition of open science practices in research evaluation. To achieve these goals, they should operate openly and interoperably whenever possible. Additionally, they should provide published texts, data, and software in a machine-readable format, and ensure long-term accessibility to the published material.\nWe thank the speakers and participants of the conference for sharing their expertise and contributing to the development of the statements. We also appreciate the valuable reflections and input from our commentators.\nThose interested in more information about the conference can refer to the report published by (Meistring and Ferguson 2023).

    "title": "Blogs as a blueprint for community-led Open Access publishing",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Scholarly blogs can disseminate current research content quickly and beyond their own specialist community and put it up for discussion. Open communication without paywalls increases the visibility of scholarly research. Researchers as well as information infrastructure and cultural institutions therefore have an interest in supporting scholarly blogs as an Open Access publication format. But what can the individual actors do to strengthen and further develop scholarly blogs and how do scholarly blogs fit into current discussions about the science-led development of the Open Access transformation (Pampel et al. 2024)?\nDuring the workshop ‘Blogs as a blueprint for community-led Open Access publishing’ which took place as a part of the Open-Access-Tage 2024, the role of blogs within science communication was discussed using three statements (“Open-Access-Tage: Mittwoch, 11.09.2024” n.d.).\nThe workshop was organized and moderated by Evin Dalkilic from Verfassungsblog, Martin Fenner from Front Matter, Mareike König from the German historical Institute Paris, Catharina Ochsner from the Berlin School of Library and Information Science at the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin , Heinz Pampel, also from Berlin School of Library and Information Science as well as the Helmholtz Open Science Office and Ulrike Stockhausen from the Max Weber Foundation / de.hypotheses. The workshop was aimed at scientists, as well as information and publication professionals. The aims of the workshop were: to create a deeper understanding of the importance of scholarly blogs as an instrument of scholarly and science communication, to strengthen the recognition of their contribution to an open and sustainable research culture, and to identify needs for the further development of community-led open access publication infrastructures, based on the experiences of the participants (“Open-Access-Tage: Mittwoch, 11.09.2024” n.d.).\nTogether with the participants, statements on the following three topics were discussed: (1) workflow-related basic services, (2) networking services and (3) reputation management of scholarly blogs.\n\nDiscussion 1: Workflow-related basic services Statement:\n“Scholarly blogs must provide the same basic services as other forms of scientific publication: including PID assignment with relevant metadata, indexing in relevant catalogs, provision of full texts in various formats and long-term archiving.”\nA central topic in the discussion on thesis 1 was the question of the definition of scholarly blogs: What formats and content characterize ‘scholarly blogs’? Which components should be archived in the long term? This also raises the question of whether authors are interested in permanent availability. Since the role of blogs varies greatly depending on discipline, bloggers also have different requirements for their archiving. The format also raises the question of whether discussions and comments, which are important additions to the blog posts, should and can be archived. The participants emphasized that the responsibility for making blogs and their content findable, visible and accessible in the long term lies not only with the bloggers, but also with information infrastructure institutions.\n\n\nDiscussion 2: Networking services\nStatement: “Scholarly blogs are living networks and show research at its best: open, transparent, serious.”\nOnce again, the participants discussed issues relating to the definition and function of scholarly blogs and the quality assurance of content, as scholarly blogs are used for very different purposes and with different requirements - while some have their own editorial boards, others focus more on popular science communication. In the discussion, it became clear that quality assurance on scholarly blogs can be made possible primarily through openness and transparency (e.g. through versioning and comments). The connection of many blogs to research institutes or third-party funded projects also creates transparency and quality assurance. The possibility of low-threshold commenting and discussing content also contributes significantly to quality assurance (keyword: open peer review).\nWith regard to the quality assurance of scholarly blogs in comparison to the traditional scholarly publication landscape, the concern was also expressed that traditional publishing structures - such as gatekeeping by editorial offices and publishers- could be adopted in the blog landscape, although blogs should offer a more open format for scientific communication.\n\n\nDiscussion 3: Reputation management\nStatement: “Science blogs as a low-threshold, genuinely freely accessible and digital publication format are particularly suitable for reputation building.”\nQuestions of quality assurance, trustworthiness and scientific rigor were also discussed as part of the third statement. However, the answers to these questions also depend on the blog’s target audience. Should the interested public or the scientific community be addressed? The primary target audience has a decisive influence on how research is communicated and from whom recognition and reputation are expected. It was also observed that the reputation of blog posts depends on the respective blog and their discipline. Open peer reviews, e.g. through comment columns, were mentioned as a means of quality assurance, but consideration was also given to orienting oneself on existing quality assurance procedures for journals or other journalistic outlets. At the same time, blogs also offer the opportunity to break away from traditional publishers and establish themselves as an independent, academic publication format. In particular, blogs make it possible to develop and test new ideas. They often serve as a starting point for more extensive publications such as journal articles - which then also incorporate the discussions on the blog.\nConclusion Scholarly blogs offer a diverse format for presenting and discussing scientific ideas and research results at an early stage, flexibly and with a low threshold. They can serve as an independent publication platform for scholarly and science communication. Although quality and reputation can vary depending on the discipline and blog, scholarly blogs have the potential to establish themselves as a serious, open and transparent publication medium. Quality assurance, archiving and recognition represent a challenge that differs from traditional publications. In addition, very fundamental questions arise, such as the definition of scholarly blogs, i.e. their formal, technical and content requirements, or their function as a medium of science communication.\nUpdates and further information on the Infra Wiss Blog can be found on the Project Website On December 06, 2024, the project team at the Berlin School of Library and Information Science will organize a networking workshop in Berlin at the Einstein Center Digital Future (ECDF) in Berlin. The event will be held in German. Registration is possible here. We look forward to further discussions on the topic.\nFurther information about the research and teaching group, Information Management, at the Berlin School of Library and Information Science can be found on the official group website.\nThis text – excluding quotes and otherwise labelled parts – is licensed under the CC BY 4.0 DEED.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n“Open-Access-Tage: Mittwoch, 11.09.2024.” n.d.

    "text": "Together with Christian Agi, Michael Beurskens, Marion von Francken, Judith Ludwig, and Bernhard Mittermaier, I have been working on recommendations for the inclusion of artificial intelligence in license agreements with publishers over the past few months. As part of the Task Force “Regulations on Artificial Intelligence in License Agreements,” within the focus area “Digitalization in Science” of the Alliance of German Science Organizations (Bertelmann et al. 2023), we addressed legal frameworks concerning permissions and prohibitions related to Text and Data Mining (TDM) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) under German law. Our work has led to recommendations for contract design. The recommendations are primarily intended for those negotiating license agreements with publishing service providers and those working with these contracts in libraries. It also indirectly benefits researchers who wish to use licensed content for TDM and AI applications. The recommendations are now available in both German (Agi et al. 2024b) and English (Agi et al. 2024a). The goal of the focus area”Digitalization in Science” is to identify the needs of scientists concerning digital infrastructures and services, engage in dialogue with relevant communities, develop practical expertise to support the scholarly work of Alliance organizations, and help shape the framework for digital research. The initiative is guided by principles that prioritize Open Access, while also ensuring sovereignty over data, tools, and infrastructures.

    "text": "I recently had the opportunity to speak on Deutschlandfunk about the Wayback Machine from the Internet Archive. The occasion was the recent cyberattack on the Internet Archive (Schräer 2023). The Wayback Machine plays a crucial role in preserving websites and providing access to our digital past—for researchers, journalists, and the interested public alike.\nThe preservation of other types of digital information is also important, for example the data researchers base their findings on. Together with colleagues, our team at the Berlin School of Library and Information Science at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, examined the ongoing operation of research data repositories. These repositories are of great importance to the scientific community, as they preserve data and facilitate data exchange among researchers. In our sample of 3,000 research data repositories, we found last year that repository shutdowns are not uncommon: 6% of the repositories we examined were no longer online at the time of our study (Strecker et al. 2023).\n\nThese findings, and the recent incident threatening the Wayback Machine, show that maintaining our digital heritage requires robust information infrastructures. Information Science research can contribute towards this goal by investigating threats to the availability of information resources.\nAs part of the Infra Wiss Blogs project funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG), we are currently working on assessing and ensuring the permanent accessibility of scholarly blogs (Pampel and Rothfritz 2024; Ochsner 2024).\nAnother part of the Deutschlandfunk program discusses the current copyright proceedings surrounding the Internet Archive.

    "text": "On December 6th, 2024, we hosted the first workshop of our project Infra Wiss Blogs (Ochsner and Pampel 2024), funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG). The aim of the workshop was to bring together scholarly bloggers and experts from information infrastructure institutions, so they could exchange experiences, wishes and challenges concerning scholarly blogs.\nIn the following, we give a brief overview of the workshop, the talks and discussions, and outline how we will continue our work following the results of the workshop. Following the welcome address, we presented the initial results of a survey of German scholarly blogs that we conducted as a part of the Infra Wiss Blogs project. Afterward, the workshop was enriched by multiple presentations around the topic of scholarly blogs and their long term accessibility.\nHenning Krause from the Helmholtz Association began with an overview of the Helmholtz Blogs, the blog portal of Germany’s largest research organization. He talked about challenges and opportunities with science communication, using blogs as an example.\nThis talk was followed by a presentation from Martin Fenner from Front Matter, on the topic of long term accessibility of scholarly blogs and the the Rogue Scholar blog archive.\nLastly, these presentations were followed by two inputs from practitioners within the field by Charmaine Voigt from GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences, and Britta Woldering from the German National Library. Charmaine Voigt presented the results of a survey on science blogs and podcasts at scientific institutions in Germany in the GESIS Wi⁴impact project. Britta Woldering introduced the work of the German National Library (DNB) in the field of web archiving and described the DNB’s approach to handling blogs for the permanent accessibility of digital content.\nThe available presentations of the speakers were published on Zenodo and can be found below:\n\nFenner, M.

Infra Wiss Blogs Vernetzungsworkshop 2024, Berlin. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14355206\n\nThe presentations and the results of the survey of German scholarly blogs were then discussed by the workshop organizers, the participants, and the speakers. To structure the discussion, we prepared a set of questions on the topic, e.g. “How can bloggers, libraries and archives work together to create standardized metadata and procedures for long-term accessibility for academic blogs?”. The main topic of discussion was how scholarly bloggers and infrastructure institutions can work together, to ensure the long term access of scholarly blogs.\nThe following challenges were identified concerning the standardization of scholarly blogs and their long term accessibility:\n\nInsufficient provision of metadata\nInsufficient licensing information\nDynamic contents, such as pictures or videos, comments, link rot pose technical and legal challenges\nBloggers’ lack of knowledge about the technical and legal requirements to ensure long term accessibility\nBlogs and other knowledge transfer and science communication activities are usually not adequately recognized in the scientific reputation system and the evaluation of research performance\n\nThe following strategies to enhance long term accessibility of scholarly blogs were proposed during the discussion:\n\n(Re-)using standardized formats (such as XML or JSON) that are already being used by blogs for the long term archiving\nIncluding licensing information into metadata. Recommended for use is the CC BY license\nLegal challenges of archiving comments could be solved through legal notice\nLibraries as educational institutions can help educate bloggers on blog requirements\nUniversities and other research performing organizations can support bloggers through offering platforms or better maintaining existing ones and by recognizing blogging as part of knowledge transfer and science communication\n\nThe discussion illustrated the diversity of the stakeholders. All participants agreed that there is a further need for stronger networking and collaboration on the topic. The participants also emphasized the need for support from universities and research institutions, as well as funding bodies, for their blogging researchers.\nThe workshop enabled us to bring together diverse perspectives from people involved in blogs, infrastructure, and science communication. We learned a lot and received numerous suggestions for the project. We thank all the speakers and participants for their contributions and the open discussions.\nBuilding on the results of the survey of German blogs, we will start conducting in-depth interviews with scholarly bloggers to investigate the infrastructural challenges of scholarly blogs and possible solutions.\nAdditionally, We are currently working on publishing the results of our survey on German scholarly blogs. We will communicate the publication of the article through our mailing list.

    "text": "In my PhD research, I look at DataRescue or Data Refuge movements, for example through the work of the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative (EDGI) (“Environmental Data & Governance Initiative” n.d.) to understand how people respond when they fear data is at risk. I’m particularly interested in what these efforts reveal about how public data infrastructures actually work—not just as systems of information storage, but as objects of political struggle.\nThis research started quite some time ago with an overarching topic of trust and distrust in public data infrastructures (Rothfritz 2024a). I planned for the first iteration of the DataRescue movement to serve as a case study for this research (Rothfritz 2024b). Of course, I did not anticipate that there would be another series of events which would lead to the loss of access to public information and data in the U.S. so soon.\n\nRescuing Data\nIn 2016, a group of librarians, archivists, and environmental activists saw the writing on the wall: the incoming U.S. administration might threaten access to crucial federal climate data. What followed was a series of DataRescue events: community-led efforts to archive and preserve environmental datasets that many feared would be deleted, altered, or buried in bureaucratic obscurity (Janz 2017; Currie and Paris 2018)\nFast forward to 2025. Another major political shift is unfolding in the U.S., and with it, new concerns about the integrity and accessibility of public data. This time around, large amounts of public federal information such as websites (Singer 2025) and data (Koebler 2025) are disappearing from public access again. The scale and breadth of which kind of information is disappearing is arguably larger though - it concerns not just environmental data and climate change mentions on websites, but also for example health data and information from the Centers for Disease and Control Prevention (CDC) (Sun, Keating, and Nirappil 2025; Cox et al. 2025). Efforts seem to be more strategic and orchestrated.\nThe good news is that at least to a pretty far extent preparations were taking place before the Trump administration took office in January. For example, all federal websites were archived through the End-Of-Term Web Archive, a project which routinely has been doing this for administration changes in the U.S. since 2008 (“End of Term Web Archive” n.d.). A dataset of CDC data uploaded before January 28th, 2025 is available on the Internet Archive. EDGI and the Public Environmental Data Project have worked ahead to archive crucial environmental data (EDGI 2025).\nThere are quite a few other initiatives taking place at the moment. A good overview resource is collected through IASSIST on this Google Doc, which is constantly being updated.\n\n\nWhy This Matters\nPublic data infrastructures—the systems that store and provide access to government data—are often taken for granted. We assume that scientific reports, climate models, and environmental monitoring data will always be there when we need them. But these infrastructures are not just technical systems; they are deeply political. Decisions about what gets collected, what remains accessible, and what disappears are shaped by power, policy, and priorities.\nThe Data Rescue events of 2016–2017 brought together scientists, librarians, and civic tech communities to back up environmental datasets they feared could vanish under the Trump administration. At first glance, the movement looked like a technical project—downloading datasets, copying them to safer locations. But it was just as much an act of political resistance (Paris 2017).\nLooking back, one of the most fascinating aspects of Data Rescue is that very little data actually disappeared. Yet the movement wasn’t a failure per se, even though most of the rescued data was not usable and the collection was far from complete (Lamdan 2017). It revealed something crucial: it wasn’t just about saving data; it was about making government accountability visible (Dillon et al. 2017, 2019). One theory might be that the fact that people felt the need to take matters into their own hands showed a loss of trust in official assurances represented by federal infrastructures.\nNow, nearly a decade later, similar concerns are emerging. As the political landscape in the U.S. shifts once again. This time around,\nI am currently speaking with people who were in one way or another involved in the first DataRescue events. Some of them have continued to monitor federal data policies and website changes over the years. Their work is a reminder that data loss isn’t always dramatic—sometimes, it’s a slow erosion of accessibility, funding cuts, or subtle changes to the language used in official reports.\nIf there’s one thing the past decade has taught us, it’s that data isn’t neutral and neither are the infrastructures they are connected to. Public data infrastructures are shaped by politics, and in turn, they shape what we know about the world. Understanding how these systems work—and how they can be protected—will be critical in the years ahead.\nFurther information about the research group can be found on our official website.\nThis text – excluding quotes and otherwise labelled parts – is licensed under the CC BY 4.0 DEED.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n“CDC Datasets Uploaded Before January 28th, 2025 : Centers for Disease Control and Prevention : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming.” n.d.

Für die Finanzierung von Open-Access-Publikationen stellen Publikationsfonds eine tragende Säule dar. Die Etablierung von Informationsbudgets dagegen befindet sich noch in der Aufbauphase. Zur Förderung der Open-Access-Transformation sollte die Finanzierung weiter untersucht werden. Diese und weitere Ergebnisse können den Vortragsfolien (Strecker, Pampel, and Höfting 2025) entnommen werden. Eine Publikation dazu ist in Vorbereitung."

Interesse weckten beispielsweise die für das Monitoring in den Einrichtungen genutzten Tools und die Verwendung der Daten für die strategische Planung. Kritisch diskutiert wurde die Belastbarkeit von bestehenden Datensammlungen zu Open Access. Mehrere Fragen adressierten die Notwendigkeit von Standardisierung in diesem Bereich."

    "text": "Paneldiskussion mit Mitgliedern der DEAL-Gruppe\nAn der Paneldiskussion nahm seitens der DEAL-Gruppe Karin Ilg (Hochschule Bielefeld) teil (weitere Mitglieder der DEAL-Gruppe mussten ihre Teilnahme kurzfristig absagen) . und teilte ihre Perspektive auf die Ergebnisse. Sie hob positiv hervor, dass einige Einrichtungen trotz schwieriger Rahmenbedingungen – wie der teilweise dezentralen Erfassung durch mehrere Abteilungen in verschiedenen Systemen – bereits einen systematischen Überblick über ihre Publikationskosten erreicht haben. Gleichzeitig betonte sie, dass flächendeckende Monitoringaktivitäten noch fehlten. In dieser Phase der Open-Access-Transformation sei eine aktivere Rolle der Leitungsebenen sowie eine stärkere Vernetzung zwischen Einrichtungen erforderlich. Auf die Herausforderungen bei der Etablierung von Informationsbudgets angesprochen verwies sie auf erhebliche Hürden, stellte aber auch die strukturbildenden Effekte von Programmen wie Open-Access-Publikationskosten der DFG und von DEAL heraus. Die communitybasierte Entwicklung einheitlicher Standards der Datenerfassung stelle einen dringenden Handlungsbedarf dar."

    "text": "I had the great opportunity to be part of the CERN-NASA working group “Infrastructure for Open Scholarship”. This working group was established following the 2023 CERN-NASA Summit “Accelerating the Adoption of Open Science”. As a result of the summit, a closing statement was published, outlining key areas of action for Open Science (Tananbaum et al. 2023).\nUnder the umbrella of the Open Research Funders Group (ORFG) and with financial support from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, key topics from the closing statement were further developed in working groups. One of these working groups focused on the advancement of open science infrastructures. Our working group has now published its results in the form of a set of recommendations for funding organizations (Arancio et al. 2024).\n\nExcerpt: “These recommendations for funders are accompanied by a set of principles for open infrastructure projects that complements the first set and aims to increase the quality of service provided to researchers and institutions. The group aims to emphasize that the principles for infrastructure initiatives do not have a prescriptive approach; instead, the goal should be to foster good practices in the field. This work intends to add and build on the corpus of work that has been undertaken globally in this area, some of which is referenced at the end of this document. As with any global framework, it will need to be regionally situated to ensure feasibility, efficacy, and sustainability in a diversity of contexts.”\nRecommendations for funding agencies based on a set of core principles were created. These principles encompass the topics of infrastructure in open scholarship policies, recognizing work, funding and support, capabilities, and transparency.\nMany thanks to Julieta Arancio for her effective and cooperative leadership of the working group, and to all participants for their openness.\nThis text – excluding quotes and otherwise labelled parts – is licensed under the CC BY 4.0 DEED.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nArancio, Julieta, Claudia Alarcón-López, Heinz Pampel, Sherry Lake, César Pallares, Esther Plomp, Miho Funamori, Tanja Friedrich, Emmy Tsang, and CERN-NASA Working Group \"Infrastructure for Open Scholarship\". 2024. “Science Funders: Commitments Towards Open Infrastructure,” June. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11444361.\n\n\nTananbaum, Greg, Chelle Gentemann, Kamran Naim, Christopher Marcum, Eric Emsellem, Eunice Mercado-Lara, Tanja Friedrich, et al. 2023. “Sowing the Seeds of Global Open Science Coordination,” November. https://doi.org/10.5281/ZENODO.10059154.\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{pampel2024,\n  author = {Pampel, Heinz},\n  title = {Recommendations for {Funding} {Organizations} on {Open}\n    {Science} {Infrastructures}},\n  date = {2024-06-11},\n  url = {https://doi.org/10.59350/n1143-h4119},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nPampel, Heinz. 2024. “Recommendations for Funding Organizations on\nOpen Science Infrastructures.” June 11, 2024. https://doi.org/10.59350/n1143-h4119."
