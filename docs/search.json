    "text": "The Infra Wiss Blogs project by the Research Group Information Management was represented at this year’s Open Access Days with the workshop “Scholarly blogs as an integral part of the open access landscape”. The workshop was organised by Catharina Ochsner and Heinz Pampel (Humboldt Universität zu Berlin (HU Berlin), Berlin School of Library and Information Science (IBI) in collaboration with Björn Gebert (Mittelalterblog & Niedersächsische Staats-und Universitätsbibliothek Göttingen), Melanie Seltmann (HU, IBI) and Ulrike Wuttke (University of Applied Sciences Potsdam, SeDOA).\nGuided by the question “How can science blogs be institutionally anchored as an integral part of the open access landscape?” participants examined the opportunities and challenges of institutionally linking scholarly blogs. Initial results from the Infra Wiss Blogs project were presented (Ochsner et al. 2025). The aim of the workshop was to develop an understanding of the role of blogs as sustainable open access infrastructures, identify institutional challenges and develop solutions for the institutional integration of scholarly blogs in order to promote science blogs in the spirit of open access in a sustainable manner. This blog post documents the workshop from the organisers’ perspective."

    "text": "Thesis 1\nInformation infrastructure facilities must offer the possibility of archiving and persistent addressing of science blogs. On the one hand, participants emphasised that scholarly blogs are important for the visibility and accessibility of scientific content and should therefore be included in long-term archiving in a similar way to other forms of publication. On the other hand, participants pointed out that resources, responsibilities and technical standards still remain unclear. A recurring issue concerned the independence of bloggers. Many participants value the freedom to publish without institutional guidelines. Yet, it was also acknowledged that long-term archiving requires rules and processes. Scholarly blogs, described during the workshop as the “punk rock of publishing,” are spontaneous, independent, and unconventional—features not always compatible with formal requirements. Also, some bloggers wished to maintain a possibility to delete their posts in the future. As a possible solution, participants suggested plugins that make metadata easily reusable, among other things. Discussion also focused on which actors should be responsible for long-term availability: a mandatory deposit at the German National Library (DNB), state library repositories, consortia, or collaboratively maintained infrastructures. Federalism was identified as an obstacle in this context. Participants also opposed granting monopoly positions to single institutions, not least with regard to the researchers’ own academic journey from one institution to another, instead advocating for an independent infrastructure. Responsibility for the long-term availability of scholarly blogs was also assigned to scholarly blog platforms, in particular Hypotheses. According to the participants, these should develop an archiving strategy, also in cooperation with the German National Library (DNB). In contrast, those who host a blog themselves are responsible for its long-term availability, according to the participants."

    "text": "Thesis 2\nScholarly bloggers are encouraged to ensure that they comply with open science practices and FAIR principles.\nAccording to the participants, there were also differing perspectives on this topic. On the one hand, it was acknowledged that bloggers should bear a minimum degree of personal responsibility. On the other hand, the participants agreed that individual researchers could not be expected to have comprehensive technical or information science knowledge. The participants emphasised that the motivation of many bloggers lies primarily in making their topic accessible and bringing it into scientific discourse – not in systematically pursuing open science. According to the participants, libraries and information infrastructures could play an important role here: they could transfer skills, create technical frameworks and facilitate compliance with standards. Participants critically discussed the applicability of the FAIR principles (Wilkinson et al. 2016). Since the FAIR principles were originally developed for research data, they are not a “natural fit” for blogs and would need adaptation, according to statements made in the workshop. In addition, participants pointed out that not all bloggers want to make their content interoperable or reusable – especially with regard to its use by Artificial Intelligence (AI) processes. Instead of rigid requirements, it was therefore suggested that specific guidelines for blogs be developed, based, for example, on the principles of good scientific practice (GWP) that also names blogs as a publication medium (Forschungsgemeinschaft 2025). The contributions also made it clear that blanket demands carry the risk of reinforcing existing inequalities among bloggers. According to the participants, many scholars have neither the time nor the technical resources to comply with complex standards. It therefore remains important to respect the autonomy of bloggers while providing low-threshold support services."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Long Night of Science (Lange Nacht der Wissenschaften - LNdW) is one of the most well-known public science events in Germany, providing research institutions with a platform for science communication. During this annual event, researchers present their work to an interested and engaged public.\nOur research group at the Berlin School of Library and Information Science (IBI) at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin participated in the Berlin event for the first time this year, joining the celebration of LNdW’s 25th anniversary (Pampel et al. 2025).\nThrough our affiliation with the Einstein Center Digital Future (ECDF), we had the opportunity to collaborate with Friedrich Schmidgall, head of the ECDF Micro Factory, to develop a hands-on exhibit showcasing our research in the field of information management.\nThe ECDF Micro Factory provides ECDF researchers with space and experimental formats to explore ideas and create solutions outside of traditional academic structures. It offers both conceptual and technical support for the development of tangible and digital objects, using prototyping methods ranging from paper and cardboard to mockups and 3D-printed materials.\nOur goal was to convey key concepts of Information Management and Open Science practices in a playful and accessible way. In our initial discussions with Friedrich Schmidgall, we came up with the idea of an animated “data puzzle” titled Information Management for Open Science, designed to illustrate two central themes of our research.\nFriedrich Schmidgall then transformed our idea into an interactive exhibit in the form of a physical puzzle and a projected animation.\nThe installation featured a tabletop puzzle illuminated by an overhead projector. At first glance, visitors saw only projected outlines on the table surface, indicating empty spaces for the puzzle pieces, each marked with a unique icon representing a specific subject of the “data puzzle”. The interactive experience invited participants to find physical puzzle pieces with matching icons and place them in their designated spaces. With each correct placement, a new segment of the larger “data puzzle” emerged, revealing subject-specific information and QR codes that linked to an identifier online. As the puzzle took shape piece by piece, the complete visualization gradually emerged, guiding visitors through concepts of information management with both visual and tactile exploration.\n\n\n\nVisitors and team members in conversation at the puzzle installation (Credit: ECDF/PR/allefarben-foto)\n\n\nTo enable this interaction, we fitted the nine laser-cut acrylic puzzle pieces with uniquely positioned magnets. These magnets interacted with Hall effect sensors embedded in the tabletop surface. Only correctly placed puzzle pieces aligned their magnet with a sensor, thus triggering the projection of the corresponding segment of the “data puzzle”. The sensors were connected to an Arduino microcontroller running Firmata, communicating sensor data to a host computer through serial connection. Processing of the sensor data and projection control were handled by the programmable multimedia toolkit vvvv beta. The vvvv patch also included a GUI that allowed fine-tuning of the projection’s position and scale, ensuring proper alignment even if the projector was not mounted perfectly.\n\n\n\nModel of the puzzle (Credit: ECDF/Friedrich Schmidgall)\n\n\nWe tested the object in various research contexts. In the first version, we used an abstract example unrelated to a specific research project. During the trials, we found that explaining the interplay between people, projects, research data, infrastructures, and other resources of scholarly work often required concrete, real-world examples. In response, our second prototype used developments in CRISPR gene editing as a case study, which, while more engaging, highlighted specific challenges in communicating aspects of Open Science in the life sciences.\n\n\n\nModel of the puzzle (Credit: ECDF/Friedrich Schmidgall)\n\n\nWe ultimately selected the MOSAiC expedition as the central example for our installation, the largest Arctic research expedition in history. Its relevance to climate research and the use of a large-scale research infrastructure, namely, research vessel Polarstern, offered an ideal context for conveying fundamental concepts of Information Management.\nThe interactive “data puzzle” was first presented to the public at the opening of the Long Night of Science on July 13, 2025.\nThe photos in this blog post provide a few glimpses of the exhibit in action. We were thrilled by the remarkable interest it generated. Until close to midnight, we presented our work in rotating shifts. Since the object was not entirely self-explanatory, it sparked many engaging conversations that also gave us an opportunity to reflect on our own research.\n\n\n\nVisitors and team members in conversation at the puzzle installation (Credit: ECDF/PR/allefarben-foto)\n\n\nFurther information about the research group can be found on our website.\nThis text – excluding quotes and otherwise labelled parts – is licensed under the CC BY 4.0 DEED.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nPampel, Heinz, Friedrich Schmidgall, Laura Rothfritz, Max Liebel, and Johanna Schielke. 2025. “Wissenschaftliche Ergebnisse Offen Zugänglich Machen Durch Information Management.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Scholarly blogs have established themselves as important platforms for making research findings and discourse accessible both within scientific communities and to the general public. Considering the changing social media landscape, the role of non-commercial infrastructures such as blogs or the Fediverse is becoming increasingly important. Blogs can also be seen as part of scholarly-led open access publishing (Ochsner et al. 2025).\nThe long-term accessibility of blogs, especially outside of infrastructures such as de.hypotheses.org, is a challenge that has not yet been solved. Archiving dynamic content and comments is a technical and organisational challenge, especially when such content is cited in scientific articles or even court rulings (such as in the Verfassungsblog). The hacker attacks on the Internet Archive in the fall of 2024 furthermore underline the general fragility of digital sources (Ochsner et al. 2025).\nAs part of the BID Congress 2025, the Hands-on Lab ‘Libraries as Operating and Preserving Institutions for Scholarly Blogs’ took place on 26 June in Bremen. The lab was initiated by the project ’Infra Wiss Blogs – Kooperative Informationsinfrastruktur für wissenschaftliche Blogs‘ funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) Pampel and Rothfritz (2024).\nThe aim of the Hands-on Lab was to bring together experts from the scholarly blogosphere and libraries to discuss the challenges and potential of scholarly blogs with regard to visibility, indexing and long-term accessibility. Using the World Café method, the participants discussed aspects such as technology, organisation and framework conditions for the sustainable safeguarding and visibility of scholarly blogs in moderated discussion rounds, with a particular focus on the role of libraries as potential supporting institutions (Ochsner et al. 2025).\n\nThese 1: Metadaten und Licenses\nThe first thesis was: ‘For the long-term archiving of their publications, scholarly blogs must carry out the necessary preparatory work, such as maintaining metadata and issuing (open) licences.’\nThe discussion showed that there is often a lack of awareness of these requirements in the blog community. Although blogs are valued as a low-threshold form of communication, it is precisely this low-threshold nature that is in tension with requirements such as metadata maintenance, licensing and technical standardisation.\nAccording to the discussion, the responsibility lies with the blogs or authors - for example with regard to clear licence declarations, clarification of copyright issues (e.g. for embedded images) or the uniform use of CSS classes to support automated import processes. In this context, infrastructure providers, such as libraries, are responsible for providing technical solutions such as plugins to import blog posts into their information systems, as well as providing low-threshold information services.\nThe extent to which nudging strategies could help to establish more sustainable practices was also discussed. The promotion of open licences was highlighted as a particularly relevant field of action in order to overcome legal challenges in subsequent use, for example in the context of archiving.\n\n\nThese 2: Cataloguing\nThe second thesis focused on the cataloguing of scholarly blogs: ‘The cataloguing of scholarly blogs presents libraries with new challenges, as they can only be catalogued to a limited extent using traditional cataloguing criteria.’\nThe discussion focused on how deeply blogs should be catalogued. The variety of formats - from individual posts and comments to multimedia content - as well as the often multiple authorship lead to uncertainties in library practice.\nTechnical aspects such as different platforms, software architectures or feed maintenance also make standardisation difficult. The possible use of web scraping or aggregators such as Rogue Scholar was discussed. The debate was supplemented by considerations on the sustainability of file formats (e.g. PDF-A, HTML), legal categorisation and liability for international content. One thing became clear: A more systematic approach to librarian fields of action in dealing with blogs is needed.\n\n\nThese 3: Responsibility and Infrastructure Institutions\nThe third thesis to be discussed was: “The long-term archiving of scholarly blogs must no longer be treated as a secondary task of public institutions. If necessary, this task must be secured by community-supported platforms.”\nThis statement was met with broad approval. The focus was on the question of which community can take on this role. Examples from practice showed the commitment of regional depository libraries or specialised information services (FIDs). Several participants reported on ongoing initiatives in their institutions.\nWeb archiving services and federated models such as ActivityPub were discussed as technical solutions. There was consensus that there is a need for better mapping of existing actors, activities and data flows at the infrastructure level.\n\n\nConcluding discussion\nIn the final discussion, the question of how a sustainable, community-supported archiving of scholarly blogs could be designed was discussed: centralised through a new software solution or decentralised through stronger integration of existing institutions?\nThere was a consensus that cooperative models are needed in which different actors take on different roles, for example in metadata management, storage or visibility. A systematic approach was proposed: who is already active, what infrastructures exist and how can a cooperative system be formed from them?\nThe potential of web archiving was emphasised, especially in combination with targeted metadata extraction. The idea of parallel archiving, by the DNB, discipline-specific FIDs or institutional repositories, met with broad approval.\nRogue Scholar was highlighted as an example of good practice. However, it also became clear that there is still considerable room for improvement in ensuring data flows, e.g. for linking archiving, cataloguing and referencing.\nAnother topic was the role of scholarly blogs in the reputation system. Some called for blogs to be made more visible and integrated into recognition mechanisms for research evaluation. Others emphasised the independence of blogs, analogous to preprints, but without identical rules.\nThis led to the central question of definition: When is a blog considered scientific enough? The Infra Wiss Blogs project applies a broad definition: Scholarly blogs can be understood as those blogs that are written by scholars or are concerned with scholarly topics. The participants also favoured an orientation towards relevance rather than formal scientificity.\n\n\nConclusion\nIn the Hands-on Lab, there was overwhelming support for a distributed system with various technical and organisational solutions, supported by a committed, interdisciplinary community that takes responsibility for the maintenance and visibility of scholarly blogs.\nFurther information about the research group can be found on our official Website.\nThis text – excluding quotes and otherwise labelled parts – is licensed under the CC BY 4.0 DEED.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nOchsner, Catharina, Elena Di Rosa, Martin Fenner, Sven Ködel, Heinz Pampel, Britta Woldering, Till Stadtbäumer, Charmaine Voigt, and Jonas Höfting. 2025. “Bibliotheken Als Betreibende Und Bewahrende Institutionen Für Wissenschaftliche Blogs.” In. https://nbn-resolving.org/urn:nbn:de:0290-opus4-194690.\n\n\nPampel, Heinz, and Laura Rothfritz. 2024. “Kooperative Informationsinfrastruktur Für Wissenschaftliche Blogs (Infra Wiss Blogs).” Zenodo, August. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13234482.\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{pampel2025,\n  author = {Pampel, Heinz and Stadtbäumer, Till and Fenner, Martin and\n    Ködel, Sven and Voigt, Charmaine and Woldering, Britta and Ochsner,\n    Catharina and Höfting, Jonas and Onzie Khamis, Christopher},\n  title = {Libraries as Operating and Preserving Institutions for\n    Scholarly Blogs: {Report} on a {Hands-on} {Lab} at the 113th\n    {Bibliocon}},\n  date = {2025-07-23},\n  url = {https://doi.org/10.59350/xqwyd-0g579},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nPampel, Heinz, Till Stadtbäumer, Martin Fenner, Sven Ködel, Charmaine\nVoigt, Britta Woldering, Catharina Ochsner, Jonas Höfting, and\nChristopher Onzie Khamis. 2025. “Libraries as Operating and\nPreserving Institutions for Scholarly Blogs: Report on a Hands-on Lab at\nthe 113th Bibliocon.” July 23, 2025. https://doi.org/10.59350/xqwyd-0g579."

    "text": "How can scholarly publications be made more visible, discoverable, and interconnected? This question is the focus of a student practical project conducted as part of the seminar within the module Information Production and Management (BP3) in the summer semester 2025.\nIn close collaboration with colleagues from the Coordination Office for Scholarly Publishing at the Library as well as a research associate from the “Future of Collections” research area at the Museum für Naturkunde Berlin (MfN), the students are working on an exciting task: documenting scholarly journals in Wikidata from the fields of zoology, biodiversity research, and paleontology, including taxonomy and systematics of fossil organisms, enriching them with information, and linking them to each other.\n\nAs part of this semester’s “Übung”, students received an introduction to Linked Open Data, with a particular focus on Wikidata. Especially for library applications, Wikidata is an exciting project because authorities, publications, and collections can be linked together, creating new opportunities for discovery, contextualization, and visibility.\nThe students worked with real datasets on the Museum für Naturkunde’s in-house journals Zoosystematics and Evolution (ZSE), Fossil Record (FR) and Deutsche Entomologische Zeitschrift (DEZ). Among other tasks, their work involved reviewing existing Wikidata entries, adding missing information, and linking relevant metadata (for example ISSNs, publishers, publication periods) with authority records such as the Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL), the Gemeinsame Normdatei (GND), or the Virtual International Authority File (VIAF).\nThe module at the Institute for Library and Information Science also included a visit to the Museum für Naturkunde, where students received a tour of the collections. This provided a hands-on introduction to working with real museum objects as part of their data-related assignments.\nThe edit-a-thon, embedded in a university seminar, demonstrated impressively the potential of structured, machine-readable data for digital science communication. Through the targeted recording and interlinking of publication data in Wikidata, new possibilities emerge for analysis and visualization. Tools like Scholia already offer fascinating insights into topics such as “Top Topics through Time,” author networks, or gender ratios in science.\nExamples from Scholia for individual publication periods of the three journals:\n\nZSE (2008–present): https://scholia.toolforge.org/venue/Q15755646\nFR (2008–present): https://scholia.toolforge.org/venue/Q2455930\nDEZ (1954–present): https://scholia.toolforge.org/venue/Q4037265\n\nBy systematically capturing article data from more than 160 years of publishing activity, a valuable resource is created for future research questions. Scholarly publications serve here as references and as data sources, but also as links to other entities such as groups of organisms, people, places, research expeditions, and collections (von Mering, 2024). The overarching goal is an open knowledge infrastructure for everyone, both researchers and the broader public. The Museum für Naturkunde Berlin will continue along this path with its own digitization initiatives and in collaboration with external partner projects.\nFurther information: Post about Open Cultural Data in Wikimedia Germany’s blog: Wie das Naturkundemuseum mit Linked Open Data unbekannte Forschende sichtbar macht\nFurther information about the research group can be found on our official website.\nThis text – excluding quotes and otherwise labelled parts – is licensed under the CC BY 4.0 DEED.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nvon Mering, Sabine, Erik Stolze, Katja Kaiser, and Mareike Petersen. 2024. “Sharing Data, Caring for Collections.

    "text": "Discussion\nIn the final discussion, a number of themes and questions emerged, which are summarized here.\nA first central point of discussion was the use of CC licenses for scholarly blogs. As mentioned above, Rogue Scholar only archives blogs whose posts are published under a CC-BY license. CC-BY can be seen as the standard for open access publications, as this license entails few restrictions and also corresponds most closely to the scholarly citation practice. However, subsequent archiving can lead to complex situations if blog posts in community blogs have not yet been published under an open license. In such cases, all previous authors must be contacted in order to enable subsequent licensing. It is therefore recommended that both the blog and each individual post be clearly licensed in advance.\nTechnical challenges were also discussed, such as dealing with multimedia content or comments in blogs. Unresolved issues became clear here. The role of scholarly blogs in the publication landscape was considered from several perspectives. Similarities between blog posts and pre-prints were highlighted. Martin Fenner reported on the first successful tests with peer review procedures for blog posts via the platform MetaROR (Marcum 2025). The possibility of mapping corrections and retractions of blog posts was also discussed.\nIn the context of archiving scholarlyblogs, the structural dependence on individual actors was identified as a problem. Two strategies for enabling long-term accessibility emerged from the discussion: firstly, the collective assumption of responsibility through community-supported infrastructures, and secondly, the institutional anchoring of blog offerings within established organizations."

    "text": "Diskussionspunkte\nIm Anschluss an die Vorträge hatten die Teilnehmer:innen des Webinars die Gelegenheit, Nachfragen zu stellen. Interesse weckten beispielsweise folgende zentrale Punkte:\n\nDatenquellen und Vergleichbarkeit: In der Diskussion wurde auf die Unterschiede zwischen OpenAlex, Scopus und Web of Science eingegangen. Es wurde hervorgehoben, dass OpenAlex eine breitere Abdeckung bietet. Trotz Unterschieden zwischen den Datenquellen ermöglicht die Verwendung der gleichen Methodik für die traditionelle und die Open Edition des Leiden Ranking einen Vergleich beider Versionen. Für die Open Access Dimension stützen sich alle Datenquellen auf Unpaywall, durch diesen gemeinsamen Referenzpunkt ist in diesem Aspekt bereits eine Vergleichbarkeit zwischen den Datenquellen gegeben.\nDatenqualität und Einbindung der Community: Die Diskussion hob die Bedeutung des Feedbacks aus der Community bei der Identifizierung und Korrektur von Datenfehlern in OpenAlex wurde hervor. Probleme wie die falsche Klassifizierung von Publikationstypen und Fehler bei Affiliationsdaten konnten bereits durch entsprechende Rückmeldungen an OpenAlex verbessert werden.\nInstitutionelle Strukturen und ROR: Die Komplexität von institutionellen Strukturen und ihre Abbildung im Research Organisation Registry (ROR) wurde diskutiert. CWTS korrigiert Fehler im ROR manuell und fügt zusätzliche Beziehungen für die Nutzung im Leiden Ranking hinzu. Die community-basierte Kuratierung von ROR Daten trägt ebenfalls zur Verbesserung der Genauigkeit bei.\nVerwendung von Ranking-Daten: Es wurde betont, dass die Daten des Leiden Ranking Open Edition zur Nachnutzung offen zugänglich sind. Sie können über eine Google Big Query-Instanz oder ein Webinterface abgerufen werden, wodurch die Nachnutzung für Nutzende mit unterschiedlicher technischer Versiertheit ermöglicht wird. Die Einrichtungen wurden ermutigt, mit den Daten basierend auf ihren spezifischen Interessen zu experimentieren.\nIndikatoren: Es wurde darüber diskutiert, wie man über die traditionellen Metriken hinausgehen kann, die im Zuge von Reformen der Forschungsbewertung kritisiert werden. OpenAlex bietet eine gute Grundlage für die Weiterentwicklung, beispielsweise durch die Berücksichtigung nicht-englischsprachiger Publikationen und anderer Arten von wissenschaftlichem Output.\nOpen-Access-Strategien: Die Bedeutung einer umfassenden Unterstützung für Forscher:innen, die Förderung von Diamond Open Access und ein ganzheitlicher Ansatz anstatt einer Fokussierung ausschließlich auf quantitative Maßnahmen wurden als Schlüsselstrategien zur Erreichung von “Exzellenz” im Bereich Open Access hervorgehoben.\nVollständigkeit der Hochschulbibliographie: Auf die Frage nach der Vollständigkeit der Hochschulbibliographie an der Universität Konstanz und der Möglichkeit, dieses Vorgehen auf größere Universitäten zu übertragen, antwortete Anja Oberländer, dass die Bibliographie in den Naturwissenschaften sehr vollständig ist, während es in den Geisteswissenschaften Lücken gibt. Diese sind oft auf mangelndes Engagement der Forscher:innen zurückzuführen. Größere Universitäten können dieses Vorgehen zwar übernehmen, müssen jedoch mit einem höheren Zeitaufwand und mehr Ressourcen rechnen.\nKommunikation der Ranking-Ergebnisse an die Hochschulleitung: Auf die Frage, ob die Universität Konstanz das Ranking aktiv in die Hochschulleitung einbringt, um für Open Access zu werben, erläuterte Anja Oberländer, dass dies nicht nötig ist, da die Hochschulleitung den Wert von Open Access bereits anerkennt und die Ergebnisse aktiv nutzt. Die kleine Größe der Universität erleichtert dies."

    "text": "Funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), our research project Pro OAR DE investigates current challenges in operating institutional repositories (IR) in Germany. Since completing our initial research phase—which included a systematic review and an interview study with IR managers at academic institutions—we have organized four networking forums since November 2024. In this blog post, we provide an overview of these four events.\n\nOur inaugural networking forum on “Institutional Repositories and Preprints”, held on November 19, 2024, attracted 64 participants across Germany. Following an introductory presentation by the project team, Lea-Maria Ferguson (Helmholtz Open Science Office) highlighted challenges in quality assurance, standardization, and workflows from submission to maintenance and Alexander Wagner (Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY) then focused on technical and practical aspects of integrating preprints into institutional repositories and illustrated how preprints are handled at DESY, a Helmholtz Center. Documentation and slide decks from the event are available through Zenodo.\nOur second networking forum,“Institutional Repositories and FIS/CRIS”, took place on December 11, 2024, and drew 103 participants. Daniel Beucke (Göttingen State and University Library) shared practical experiences integrating repositories with research information systems, highlighting challenges in interoperability and emphasizing the importance of networking, standards and persistent identifiers. Malte Kramer (CRIS.NRW, University of Münster) introduced the CRIS.NRW initiative from the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia, highlighting the interaction between institutional repositories and research information systems while stressing the necessity of compatible input workflows and identifier systems for successful integration. Documentation and slide decks from the event are available through Zenodo.\nThe third networking forum on “Institutional Repositories and Zweitveröffentlichung (self-archiving)” took place on January 13, 2025, with 125 participants in attendance. Sonja Härkönen from the University of Augsburg presented her library’s service-oriented approach to self-archiving based on sustainable and user-friendly workflows, addressing communication challenges with researchers and emphasizing the collaborative role of the open-access.network’s Focus Group on Self-Archiving. Tomasz Stompor (Cooperative Library Network Berlin-Brandenburg) introduced DeepGreen as a central data hub for automated delivery of publications to repositories, outlining its evolution from a DFG project to an established service. Documentation and slide decks from the event are available through Zenodo.\nOn March 10, 2025, the fourth networking forum on “On monitoring and reporting with institutional repositories” was held with 100 participants. Dirk Pieper and Julia Bartlewski (University of Bielefeld, openCost) introduced the openCost metadata schema as a standardized exchange format for publication costs and demonstrated its integration within their institutional repository as part of implementing an information budget.\nColin Sippl and Gernot Deinzer (University of Regensburg), who presented their institution’s experience with integrating publication cost management into their repository, were showing the historical development from 2011 to their current system that handles both article-level costs and publishing agreements. Documentation and slide decks from the event are available through Zenodo.\nThe insights and discussions from these networking forums, combined with the themed breakout groups held during each event, will form the foundation for developing topic-specific guidelines for open access and IR professionals throughout Germany.\nThrough these collaborative events, we have created opportunities for the open access community to collectively address key challenges in managing and evolving institutional repositories, identify practical solutions, and strengthen professional exchange across Germany’s IR landscape.\nFor more information about Pro OAR DE and our upcoming activities, please visit our official website.\nThis text – excluding quotes and otherwise labeled sections – is licensed under the CC BY 4.0 DEED.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nMatthias, Lisa, Dirk Pieper, Julia Bartlewski, Colin Sippl, and Gernot Deinzer. 2025. “Pro OAR DE Vernetzungsforum: Publikations- Und Kostenmonitoring Mit Institutionellen Repositorien,” March. https://doi.org/10.5281/ZENODO.15056242.\n\n\nWrzesinski, Marcel, Daniel Beucke, and Malte Kramer. 2024. “Pro OAR DE Vernetzungsforum: Institutionelle Repositorien Und FIS/CRIS,” December. https://doi.org/10.5281/ZENODO.14440152.\n\n\nWrzesinski, Marcel, Sonja Härkönen, and Tomasz Stompor. 2025. “Vernetzungsforum: Institutionelle Repositorien Und Zweitveröffentlichung,” January. https://doi.org/10.5281/ZENODO.14725629.\n\n\nWrzesinski, Marcel, Alexander Wagner, Lea-Maria Ferguson, and Marcel Meistring. 2024. “Pro OAR DE Vernetzungsforum: Institutionelle Repositorien Und Preprints,” November. https://doi.org/10.5281/ZENODO.14185123.\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{pampel2025,\n  author = {Pampel, Heinz and Mattihas, Lisa and Onzie Khamis,\n    Christopher},\n  title = {Networking for the {Advancement} of {Institutional} {Open}\n    {Access} {Repositories} in {Germany}},\n  date = {2025-04-22},\n  url = {https://doi.org/10.59350/s3ddy-gdm33},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nPampel, Heinz, Lisa Mattihas, and Christopher Onzie Khamis. 2025.\n“Networking for the Advancement of Institutional Open Access\nRepositories in Germany.” April 22, 2025. https://doi.org/10.59350/s3ddy-gdm33."

    "section": "Presentations",
    "text": "Presentations\nOpen Science refers to efforts to implement various approaches to an open scientific practice (UNESCO 2021), aiming to promote transparent and inclusive science.\nAt the beginning of the event, three invited speakers – Dr. Lisa Kressin from the Leibniz Association, Dr. Stefan Skupien from the Berlin University Alliance (BUA), and Marcel Meistring from the Helmholtz Centre for Geosciences (GFZ) – presented different approaches taken by libraries and research institutions regarding Open Science.\nDr. Lisa Kressin (Leibniz Association) began her presentation by discussing the crucial role of infrastructures in promoting Open Science. She also emphasized the significance of self-governance in science for the development of Open Science. According to Kressin, Open Science must be developed in close collaboration with the scientific community rather than being purely politically motivated. However, she acknowledged that political engagement remains essential to advancing Open Science. She highlighted the potential of Open Science in strengthening research quality and reinforcing scientific transparency.\nFurthermore, she addressed the challenges of Open Science in practice. Due to varying knowledge cultures, it is impossible to impose uniform expectations on all stakeholders. She advocated for a practical approach to Open Science and stressed that funding remains a pressing issue. Kressin saw great potential in networking among scientific organizations to advance Open Science.\nDr. Stefan Skupien (BUA) also highlighted the importance of Open Science networks and collaboration, as many Open Science challenges require cooperative solutions. He underscored the potential of Open Science for research and introduced measures implemented by the BUA to promote it. Besides infrastructure development, Skupien focused on Open Science education and monitoring Open Science practices. These topics are also supported by the BUA through Open Science Fellowships.\nAnother initiative he mentioned was the establishment of Open Science Ambassadors, who serve as multipliers, spreading Open Science practices within the scientific community. He pointed out that the importance of Open Science varies across faculties within the BUA institutions. Therefore, the BUA aims to establish a reflective and discipline-specific approach to Open Science practices.\nIn the final presentation, Marcel Meistring from the GFZ Helmholtz Centre for Geosciences emphasized the importance of extensive consulting, research-support services, and support offerings in the field of publishing research results and research data management. He provided insights into the Open Science policy of the Helmholtz Association and the Open Science-related guidelines of the GFZ. He stressed that such policies serve as crucial guidelines in establishing an Open Science culture within scientific institutions.\nAdditionally, he explained the relevance of adhering to standards and utilizing persistent identifiers (PIDs) for providing, archiving, storing, publishing, and linking texts, research data, and research software. The use of standards and PIDs is crucial for the efficient implementation of Open Science. Meistring also presented current efforts by the Helmholtz Association to develop new quality indicators for research data and software publications. The goal is to adopt a broader perspective on research performance, recognizing published research data and software as valuable research outputs based on specific quality criteria."

The discussion highlighted the necessity of further advancing Open Science in Germany. The panelists supported additional cross-organizational projects similar to the DEAL initiative.\nAs repeatedly emphasized in the presentations, intensified collaboration among various Open Science stakeholders is essential to effectively address challenges. However, difficulties arise due to funding constraints and a lack of institutional initiative. The monitoring of Open Science practices was identified as a crucial field of action for advancing Open Science. Additionally, promoting information literacy was deemed essential for the positive development of Open Science.\nThe discussion also touched upon the integration of Open Science principles into university curricula across all disciplines so that future researchers develop awareness of Open Science’s opportunities and challenges. In this context, the BUA Ambassadors initiative was praised for facilitating communication and exchange across different scientific domains, from which other institutions could also benefit."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In a time when research data is increasingly at the heart of research integrity, discussions about data sharing, openness, and reusability have gained prominence. Yet, the ethical complexities surrounding research data—who collects it, how it is used, and whose interests it serves—are often sidelined. The Critical Data Discourses lecture series seeks to shift the focus from purely technical concerns to broader ethical, social, and political reflections on data.\nDiscussions about data in research are often dominated by principles like FAIR (Wilkinson et al. 2016), which aim to standardize and optimize the findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability of research data. While these principles are important, they do not fully capture the ethical dimensions of data collection and use. Questions of fairness, responsibility, power dynamics, and care work in data practices are not covered by these principles.\n\nAt the same time, international discussions have introduced complementary frameworks, such as the CARE principles (Carroll et al. 2020)—developed from Indigenous governance perspectives—which emphasize the social and relational aspects of data. These principles highlight how data is not just a neutral resource but deeply intertwined with historical, social, and ethical considerations.\nWith this lecture series, we aim to bring together data professionals and critical scholars to examine the evolving landscape of data ethics and adjacent questions about data politics and data justice. Through a series of expert talks, we are exploring issues that are often missing from mainstream research data discussions, such as:\n\nThe ethics of data collection and the ethical considerations behind it\nThe role of domain-specific ethical considerations in fields like humanities, medicine, and AI research\nThe limitations of existing data frameworks and their unintended consequences\nData gaps and missing data—what is left out of research and why\nThe influence of AI and automation on knowledge production and discrimination\nThe impact of historical injustices on contemporary data practices\n\nOur motivation for organizing this series stems from a shared interest in rethinking data practices beyond efficiency and compliance, and centering on issues of ethics, justice, transparency, and responsibility. More information is available on our website.\nAfter a successful launch with over 100 participants in our first session, we are excited to continue the discussions in our upcoming talks on data ethics, AI, and power structures in research data.\nHere is a look at what’s next (in German):\n\nSession 3: 04.03.2025, 14-16 Uhr Ethik des Sammelns\nThe Dark Side of DNA: Exposing the Ethical Lapses That Threaten Human Genetics\nVortragender: Yves Moreau, University of Leuven, Belgium\nUnborn digital.

    "title": "New preprint on Transformative Agreements",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In recent years, transformative agreements (TAs) have become a go-to strategy for publishers and research performing organizations aiming to open up access to research (Farley et al. 2021). These agreements promise to bridge traditional subscription-based journal models to an Open Access (OA) future (Borrego, Anglada, and Abadal 2021). But are they delivering on that promise? In this new pre-print, my colleagues W. Benedikt Schmal, Ulrich Herb and I did a thorough analysis of 1,075 TAs in order to get the most complete picture possible with the available data.\nRothfritz, L., Schmal, W. B., & Herb, U. (2024). Trapped in Transformative Agreements? A Multifaceted Analysis of &gt;1,000 Contracts. arXiv. https://doi.org/10.48550/ARXIV.2409.20224\n\nWhat We Did: A Blend of Data Crunching and Thematic Analysis\nTo understand TAs better, we gathered data from a unique source: the ESAC Initiative, which tracks over 1,000 transformative agreements. This data, alongside additional contract details we scraped, allowed us to go beyond basic summaries. We analyzed both numbers and narratives, mixing quantitative approaches like regression analysis with qualitative coding of free-text answers collected by ESAC through their registry form. This dual approach helped us capture not only the frequency and size of agreements but also the subjective experiences libraries shared.\n\n\nKey Findings: Are Libraries Trapped?\nOne of our core findings is that TAs may not just be a stepping stone toward full OA but could be trapping libraries in hybrid models indefinitely. Here’s what stood out:\n\nDominance of Big Publishers: We found that a small number of publishers, mainly Elsevier, Springer Nature, and Wiley, dominate these agreements. These “Big 3” often secure longer contracts with more favorable terms for themselves, locking libraries into longer commitments and substantial costs.\nRising Costs, Limited Flexibility: While TAs have led to more OA articles, they don’t always reduce costs for libraries. In fact, we discovered that the larger the initial TA contract, the more likely it is to be renewed, creating a cycle of dependency. Libraries often face increased administrative burdens and costs without the savings they expected.\nCapped vs. Uncapped Contracts: Contracts come in two flavors—capped (with a limit on the number of OA articles) and uncapped. Uncapped contracts are generally preferred, as they reduce the risk of libraries exceeding their article limit and facing additional charges. However, even uncapped contracts often exclude fully OA journals, limiting the growth of the OA movement.\nWorkflow Wins and Woes: One bright spot is that many libraries reported improvements in their workflows under TAs, especially where automated tools like CCC RightsLink and others and real-time dashboards were used. Yet, issues remain—many libraries still struggle with complex, manual workflows and limited monitoring capabilities.\nMixed Feelings on Sustainability: Libraries are split on the sustainability of TAs. While some view them as a positive, affordable transition tool, others worry about long-term financial strain, especially as publishers maintain their market power and high fees.\n\n\n\nFinal Thoughts: A Double-Edged Sword?\nOur analysis suggests that while TAs have increased the number of OA articles, they might also be cementing the dominance of large publishers and creating financial traps for libraries. Rather than acting as a bridge to a fully OA landscape, TAs may become a permanent fixture, with academic institutions continually caught in a cycle of payments and negotiations (Fenter 2022; Jahn 2024; Schmal 2024).\nIt will be interesting to see how the scientific community and libraries, in their negotiations with publishers, achieve progress in contract development and how these will fit into the future Open Access mix, including strategies for community-led publishing. A particularly noteworthy case is Sweden, where the Bibsam Consortium recommends to no longer sign any TAs for hybrid journals.\nReplication code, scripts, and data used for this study are publicly available on Zenodo: https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.13453629.\nFurther information about the research group can be found on our official website.\nThis text – excluding quotes and otherwise labelled parts – is licensed under the CC BY 4.0 DEED.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBorrego, Ángel, Lluís Anglada, and Ernest Abadal. 2021. “Transformative Agreements: Do They Pave the Way to Open Access?” Learned Publishing 34 (2): 216–32. https://doi.org/10.1002/leap.1347.\n\n\nFarley, Ashley, Allison Langham-Putrow, Elisabeth Shook, Leila Belle Sterman, and Megan Wacha. 2021. “Transformative Agreements: Six Myths, Busted.” College & Research Libraries News, July. https://doi.org/10.5860/crln.82.7.298.\n\n\nFenter, Frederick. 2022. “It Is Not Transformation If Nothing Changes.” Frontiers.\n\n\nJahn, Najko. 2024. “How Open Are Hybrid Journals Included in Transformative Agreements?” arXiv. https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2402.18255.\n\n\nSchmal, W.

    "text": "This week marks the fifteenth annual International Open Access Week. Since 2010, the week has provided a platform to discuss the state and challenges of open access to scientific knowledge. While the early years focused on access to scientific articles (“Open Access Week” 2024), this year’s activities increasingly address other aspects of Open Science.\nUniversities, research labs, and libraries worldwide are participating in the week with various activities. For Germany, a list of events can be found on the website open-access.network. Since 2012, a theme has been chosen for the week each year. This year’s theme is “Community over Commercialization” (Week n.d.).\nOur research group is also participating in this year’s Open Access Week. On Monday, October 21, 2024, from 2:00 PM to 3:30 PM (CET), we are organizing a panel in collaboration with the Open-Access-Büro Berlin titled “Open Access Monitoring – Opportunities and Challenges for Open Science.” The event will be held online in German. Registration is available on the Open-Access-Büro Berlin website.\n\nAbstract (Kindling and Pampel 2024, translation by me)\nTo track the progress of the transformation to Open Access, indicators such as publication numbers or publication costs are often considered. Open data plays a key role in this. With OpenAlex (Priem, Piwowar, and Orr 2022) and the accompanying Barcelona Declaration on Open Research Information (“Barcelona Declaration on Open Research Information” n.d.), the Open Access community is well on its way to ensuring that monitoring is not left solely to commercial providers. At the same time, new challenges arise in monitoring, such as considering more advanced principles of Open Science in the context of community-led Open Access publishing or including other publication formats and practices. These questions include:\n\nHow can we track the growing number of community-led initiatives and their publication and funding models without simply counting the quantitative output of journals and articles?\nHow can institutions make their efforts to build open publication infrastructures more visible?\nHow can the implementation of strategies be made visible not only in terms of outcomes at a given point in time but also in terms of process?\nHow much influence do the things we measure and define have on the path we take in the Open Access transformation?\n\nI look forward to moderating the discussions with Irene Barbers (Forschungszentrum Jülich), Najko Jahn (University of Göttingen), Jochen Johannsen (RWTH Aachen), and Maxi Kindling (Open-Access-Büro Berlin).\nThe event is also part of the “Quo Vadis Open Science in Berlin and Brandenburg 2024/25” series, which addresses the state and perspectives of Open Science in Berlin and Brandenburg.\nFurther information about the research group can be found on our official website.\nThis text – excluding quotes and otherwise labelled parts – is licensed under the CC BY 4.0 DEED.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n“Barcelona Declaration on Open Research Information.” n.d.

    "section": "",
    "text": "We are excited to announce the launch of our new project, “Infra Wiss Blogs - Kooperative Informationsinfrastruktur für wissenschaftliche Blogs” funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG 2023).\nBlogs have become an indispensable component of digital science communication, serving as a platform for scholarly communication, a diary for documenting research findings in the context of open science, or a showcase for communicating scientific findings to the general public. However, challenges for scholarly blogs arise from unresolved issues pertaining to the permanent preservation of blog posts and the frequent lack of evidence in library records, hindering the sustainability of this publication type (Pampel and Rothfritz 2024).\nThe project Infra Wiss Blogs aims to support blogging researchers and information infrastructure institutions in identifying potential solutions for ensuring the long-term accessibility of scholarly blogs in Germany. To this end, the project facilitates and moderates a discussion process to develop a distributed system for a permanent accessibility and storage solution for scholarly blogs. Given the complexity and scope of this endeavor the development of such an information system for research requires collaborative efforts (Pampel and Rothfritz 2024).\nTo foster collaboration and promote stakeholder networking, the project will organize communication forums on this topic, bringing together science and infrastructure. This approach will facilitate coordination among actors, processes, and standards. The process should lead to the development of a distributed, organizational, technological, and cooperatively supported infrastructure that ensures the permanent accessibility of scholarly blogs. Furthermore, the project will be accompanied by a socio-technical perspective of information science (Pampel and Rothfritz 2024).\nFor further details about the project, please refer to the project proposal (Pampel and Rothfritz 2024). Additionally, we are excited to host a workshop at this year’s Open-Access-Tage in Cologne. Together with our colleagues Evin Dalkilic from Verfassungsblog, Martin Fenner from Front Matter, and Ulrike Stockhausen from the Max Weber Stiftung, we will present the workshop “Wissenschaftsblogs als Blaupause für das wissenschaftsgeleitete Open-Access-Publizieren” and discuss aspects and solutions for providing the continuous accessibility of scholarly blogs (GESIS - Leibniz-Institute for the Social Sciences et al. 2024).\nFurthermore we will be hosting the workshop “Vernetzungsworkshop Infra Wiss Blogs” on December 6th at the Einstein Center Digital Future, bringing together bloggers and stakeholders from information infrastructure facilities. At the workshop we will present a first insight into the German scholarly blogs and share experiences from both bloggers as well as information infrastructure experts.\nWe will provide updates on current activities and project outputs on the projects blog, that will be published soon, and through the Infra Wiss Blogs mailing list.\nFurther information about the research group can be found on our official website.\nThis text – excluding quotes and otherwise labeled parts – is licensed under the CC BY 4.0 DEED.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nDFG. 2023. “Förderprogramm „Verantwortung Für Informations-Infrastrukturen Gemeinsam Organisieren“ (VIGO).” https://www.dfg.de/de/foerderung/foerdermoeglichkeiten/programme/infrastruktur/lis/lis-foerderangebote/vigo.\n\n\nGESIS - Leibniz-Institute for the Social Sciences, Catholic University of Applied Sciences of North Rhine – Westphalia, TH Köln - University of Applied Sciences, University of Cologne: University and City Library of Cologne, and German National Library of Medicine. 2024. “Open-Access-Tage 2024.” Technische Informationsbibliothek (TIB). https://doi.org/10.25798/S2SD-VN02.\n\n\nPampel, Heinz, and Laura Rothfritz. 2024. “Kooperative Informationsinfrastruktur Für Wissenschaftliche Blogs (Infra Wiss Blogs).” Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13234482.\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{ochsner2024,\n  author = {Ochsner, Catharina and Pampel, Heinz},\n  title = {Project Launch: {Infra} {Wiss} {Blogs} - {Ensuring}\n    {Permanent} {Access} to {Scholarly} {Blogs}},\n  date = {2024-09-05},\n  url = {https://doi.org/10.59350/sea3s-tc489},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nOchsner, Catharina, and Heinz Pampel. 2024. “Project Launch: Infra\nWiss Blogs - Ensuring Permanent Access to Scholarly Blogs.”\nSeptember 5, 2024. https://doi.org/10.59350/sea3s-tc489."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Regardless of whether one is just starting out or has already arrived in the community, as young librarians and information scientists, there are many interesting fields and new developments. For example, there are discussions about the diverse potential of artificial intelligence in library environments, the currently developing discussion on how to handle library collections with a colonial history and context, how to incorporate comics into bibliographic data sets, or the evaluation of the major transformative agreements in Germany - just to name a few. But how can one experience all this without having to visit completely different events and locations? For instance, by attending Bibliocon.\nThis year’s 112th Bibliocon took place in Hamburg and welcomed more than 4,000 guests from 30 countries (BuB) between June 4th and 7th 2024. Over three days, there were 240 events that covered every imaginable topic in the field of library and information science (Bibliocon Program). The presentations were organized by overarching theme areas, such as library-related topics, open-access-related topics, information science-related topics, etc. In addition, there were presentations from a wide range of companies, such as publishers like Elsevier, Springer Nature or service providers like Clarivate.\nAmong the many attendees were also two student employees from the Information Management department at the Berlin School for Library and Information Science (IBI) at Humboldt University Berlin who had the great opportunity to attend the congress. As “first-timers”, our attendance was naturally about collecting as many interesting experiences as possible - both in terms of information management to enrich our work in the research group and also in our own areas of interest. To coordinate this beforehand, we could even use an app provided by the event and of course also refer to a printed program with a detailed schedule.\nAlongside an extremely enthusiastic and friendly staff, who gave us some useful tips for orientation in the massive Congress Center Hamburg (CCH), we would like to highlight the very accommodating first-timer event of the Professional Association of Information and Libraries (BIB - Berufsverband Information Bibliothek). For young trainees and students in the library sector, there was a lot of material and tips for the trade fair, as well as general guidance for navigating the profession.\n\nUnfortunately, we had to miss out on attending some events due to time overlaps with similar events or miscalculations regarding expected attendance numbers, which often was quite regrettable. Although there was a seated streaming offer on site, not all overcrowded events were streamed or could be streamed frequently. This was particularly evident at the AI panels, where there was high demand for events that focused on their practical applications and assistance functions.\nAlthough the app unfortunately only catered to iOS users, Android users could still use a browser version (not optimal but okay), and despite having very few power outlets and corresponding charging options, Bibliocon provided a spacious and practical working area. However, it must be noted that food and drink prices were not student-friendly at all.\nThe general political discussion and development also found its way onto Bibliocon. For example, there was an interesting event about Czech libraries that dealt with their positioning in political debates in the country. (Petrak 2024) Three projects from different libraries were presented that had caused a stir with events during Pride Month and a debate event on same-sex marriage.\nTwo libraries in Brno and Usti nad Labem were presented as examples of cooperation with local associations to organize Pride Month events. These included readings by drag queens for parents and children as well as an installation of a themed corner for young people featuring a “Rainbow Mailbox” similar to a complaint box where young people can anonymously express their fears, worries, or general their feelings. The drag queen readings sparked both enthusiasm and opposition in both cities; conservative parties from the regions even mobilized people to disrupt these events. What stood out about this event was how strongly they adapted their plans to suit local circumstances while also reflecting on failed approaches – such as how attention shifted mainly towards those opposed during debates divided into two evenings based on position due to higher attendance numbers among those opposing it. At the same time, speakers were open to suggestions from outside during discussions so they could incorporate them into future planning.\nSeveral panels were dedicated to the historical reevaluation of colonialism and practical conclusions for today’s work. In addition to a stimulating podium discussion, “Challenges of Cultural Heritage from Colonial Contexts in Libraries” (Müller et al. 2024) et al., with literature and cultural scientist Albert Gouaffo (University of Dschang), who was cut in from Cameroon, library representatives at the State Library in Berlin (Staatsbibliothek Berlin) had organized a workshop for discussing a guide for handling these library collections with sensitivity (Schmid and Scheibe 2024).\nAs student employees, we were naturally also interested in the various company presentations at the fair. However, there was only limited feedback after visiting several stands. We could still listen to an Elsevier presentation, where Max Vögler presented an international interview study on challenges for universities and research funding organizations, particularly research evaluation, research assessment, and the concept of the “4th Generation University”.\nVarious projects by or with involvement by the research and teaching group of Information Management (IBI) were also represented in this year’s Bibliocon program. In addition to the Hands-On Lab “Scenarios for further development of open-access repositories”(“Szenarien für die Weiterentwicklung von Open-Access-Repositorien”) (Beucke et al. 2024) in cooperation with DINI AG Elektronisches Publizieren (DINI working group Electronic Publishing), the research project “Professionalization of OAR Infrastructure in Germany” (Pampel et al. 2024) was able to present itself and initial results on analyzing challenges for developing “Next Generation Repositories”.\nJoshua Shelly (UB Potsdam) presented a study from Transform2Open (Ferguson et al. 2024) on “Process Optimization of Open Access Workflows in Academic Libraries”, which demonstrated that OA workflows need to be designed holistically and integrated into daily operations as well as various institutional departments to be sustainable, practice-oriented, and optimized. The study was developed with contributions from partner institutions such as Forschungszentrum Jülich, the Helmholtz Open Science Office, and the University of Potsdam. Additionally, the Hands-on Lab “Central Publication Cost Recording: When a Few Bucks Come Together in Science”(“Zentrale Publikationskostenerfassung: Wenn ein paar Kröten in der Wissenschaft zusammenkommen”) (Stein et al. 2024) highlighted the possibilities repositories offer for central publication cost recording. Cornelia Lang (UB Regensburg) and Lisa-Marie Stein (openCost) provided a very detailed discussion on workflow issues, centralization, and repository software. Another interesting contribution was made by Najko Jahn (SUB Göttingen), who discussed the status and development of the Open Access transformation in hybrid journals (Jahn 2024). Among other things, he introduced the Hybrid Open Access Dashboard HOAD and compared developments in the German scientific landscape with those in the international arena. Finally, we agreed that attending Bibliocon was a great enrichment and can only recommend the conference to interested students. There are many new contents and perspectives to discover that are not covered in everyday studies. However, it should be noted that the ticket, like many other conferences, is not particularly cheap, although there is a discount for students and early bookers. Therefore, it is worthwhile to book as early as possible and in conjunction with a job. In any case, the experiences are definitely worth it.\nFurther information about the research group can be found on our official website.\nThis text – excluding quotes and otherwise labelled parts – is licensed under the CC BY 4.0 DEED.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBeucke, Daniel, Isabella Meinecke, Heinz Pampel, and Marcel Wrzesinski. 2024. “Research Group Information Management @ Humboldt-Universität Zu Berlin - Report on the Hands-on Lab ‘Scenarios for the Development of Open Access Repositories’ at the 112th BiblioCon.

    "section": "",
    "text": "In the beginning of June 2024, Nature reported on the Japanese Ministry of Education’s plan to invest 10 billion yen in expanding institutional Open Access Repositories (Singh Chawla 2024). This initiative provides a good opportunity to discuss the future of Open Access Repositories at the https://2024.bibliocon.de/.\nIn collaboration with the project “Professionalization of the Open Access Repositories Infrastructure in Germany” (Pro OAR DE) (Pampel and Rothfritz 2023), funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), the Electronic Publishing Working Group (AG E-Pub) of the German Initiative for Networked Information (DINI) organized a Hands-On Lab titled “Scenarios for the Development of Open Access Repositories” on June 6, 2024, during the 112th BiblioCon. The goal was to develop scenarios for the future orientation of institutional Open Access repositories with participants from academia, libraries, and other information infrastructures.\nThe methodological approach for this event was based on the Delphi concept (Häder 2014), (Niederberger and Renn 2019). Participants were asked to evaluate predefined statements on repositories in two consecutive rounds. This method aimed to reach a consensus on specific scenarios for the future of repositories. About 30 people participated in the lab and were divided into groups of four which simultaneously discussed the scenarios. The discussions were based on eight statements that were prepared by the organizers in advance and addressed aspects of the development of Open Access repositories.\nFirst, each group assessed the eight statements with the aim of coming to a consensus about the topic. For example, participants were asked to discuss the following proposition: “Preprints play an important role in the informational expansion of repositories.” Each group needed to develop a joint position on this and the other seven statements, by rating them on a scale from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree.”\nIn the following round, each group further explored three statements and discussed strategies and concrete measures to address the issues raised in each statements. The goal was to develop practical approaches to the topics, based on a shared understanding of the statements, focusing on the joint discussion of solution strategies.\n\nLessons Learned\nThe chosen method did not allow for in-depth examination and was not representative, but it enabled a focused and useful discussion of current issues facing institutional repositories. Reaching a consensus was challenging, as interpretations of the statements varied significantly among participants, and evaluations differed depending on perspectives and group compositions.\nFor the following three statements, approval ratings were identified in all four groups (grouped as “somewhat agree” and “strongly agree”):\n\nRepositories’ user interfaces should become more intuitive and modern.\nText and data repositories should intensify their exchange with each other.\nRepositories should take more measures to increase the visibility of their content.\n\nIn the second round, the following implementation strategies were discussed for these three statements:\nRepositories’ user interfaces should become more intuitive and modern:\n\nOffer multilingual user interfaces that support languages beyond German and English.\nSimplify uploads through data import via API integration (e.g., DOI queries via Crossref).\nEliminate mandatory fields that researchers must fill out.\nEnsure responsiveness on various devices.\n\nText and data repositories should intensify their exchange with each other:\n\nEnsure automatic data flows between research data repositories and institutional Open Access repositories.\nSimplify uploads through data import via API integration (e.g., DOI queries via Crossref).\nEvaluate local architecture to determine whether a generic repository for all object types or different repositories for each publication type is more practical.\n\nRepositories should take more measures to increase the visibility of their content:\n\nDisplay bibliographic data in the OPAC or Discovery System.\nIndex bibliographic data in search services .\nActively implement search engine optimization measures.\nEnable automated data flows via persistent identifiers.\n\nThe authors thank the participants for their open discussions and for sharing their experiences on strategies to further professionalize Open Access repositories.\nThe results will also be used for the further development of the DINI Certificate for Open-Access Publication Services and in the ongoing work of the Pro OAR DE project. Workshops on some aspects will be held in the further course of the Pro OAR DE project.\nFurther information about the research group can be found on our official website.\nThis text – excluding quotes and otherwise labeled parts – is licensed under the CC BY 4.0 DEED. \n\nPhoto Credit: Melanie Seltmann, licensed under the CC BY 4.0 DEED.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nHäder, Michael. 2014.

    "text": "We are excited to announce the launch of our new project, “Data Practices for Shaping Open Access Transformation - Analysis, Recommendation, Training & Networking - OA Datenpraxis” funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation).\nTogether with our colleagues at the Helmholtz Open Science Office and the Scholarly Communication Analytics Team at the Lower Saxony State and University Library Göttingen (SUB), we, the research group Information Management at the Berlin School of Library and Information Science (IBI), will work towards strengthening structures for the use of data on the open access transformation at research institutions in Germany.\nThe project supports practitioners in research administration, libraries and other service institutions in professionalizing their data practices through various activities. As a first step, the team at IBI will conduct a comprehensive study on how research institutions handle publication costs. Our research will build on existing research and previous work of the project partners. Our goal is to get a better understanding of current practices and challenges associated with managing data on Open Access publications and associated costs.\nIn strengthening the abilities of research institutions to leverage data to monitor publication output and associated costs, we are addressing some of the recommendations of the German Council of Science and Humanities for fostering the Open Access transformation in Germany (Wissenschaftsrat 2022). Additional information about the project and its goals can be found in the project proposal (in German) (Pampel et al. 2024).\nAt this year’s Open-Access-Tage in Cologne, we are organizing a workshop with Open-Access-Büro Berlin, Vernetzungs- und Kompetenzstelle Open Access Brandenburg and Open Access Monitor at Forschungszentrum Jülich (FZJ). If you are interested in Open Access reporting and are attending, please feel free to approach us at the conference or contact us via email.\nWe will report on current activities and project outputs on the project website and Mastodon.\n\nFurther information about the research group can be found on our official website.\nThis text – excluding quotes and otherwise labeled parts – is licensed under the CC BY 4.0 DEED.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nPampel, Heinz, Najko Jahn, Roland Bertelmann, Wolfram Horstmann, Laura Rothfritz, Lea Maria Ferguson, Birgit Schmidt, and Anna Stisser. 2024. “Datenpraxis Zur Gestaltung Der Open-Access-Transformation - Analyse, Empfehlung, Training & Vernetzung (OA Datenpraxis).” https://doi.org/10.5281/ZENODO.10794298.\n\n\nWissenschaftsrat. 2022. “Empfehlungen Zur Transformation Des Wissenschaftlichen Publizierens Zu Open Access.” https://doi.org/10.57674/FYRC-VB61.\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{strecker2024,\n  author = {Strecker, Dorothea and Pampel, Heinz},\n  title = {Project Launch: {OA} {Datenpraxis-} {Data} {Practices} for\n    {Shaping} the {Open} {Access} {Transformation}},\n  date = {2024-06-19},\n  url = {https://doi.org/10.59350/es0dc-vhb02},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nStrecker, Dorothea, and Heinz Pampel. 2024. “Project Launch: OA\nDatenpraxis- Data Practices for Shaping the Open Access\nTransformation.” June 19, 2024. https://doi.org/10.59350/es0dc-vhb02."

    "title": "Research Data Publications Between Dynamism and Persistence - Insights from the #PIDsBUA Workshop",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Research is inherently dynamic, leading to equally dynamic data. This dynamic nature of research data raises numerous questions for professionals in information management at research institutions, libraries, and computing centers. Despite the conceptual establishment of research data citation through persistent identifiers (PIDs) in some communities, practical challenges remain. This is the case within the infrastructure of repositories and journals, particularly regarding their practices, guidelines, and standards.\nOur team at the Research Group Information Management at the Berlin School of Library and Information Science is dedicated to understanding research data versioning as part of information management processes at research-performing organizations (RPOs). With the project “PID Reference Model for Research Data Versioning” (#PIDsBUA) funded by the “Advancing Research Quality and Value” fellowship program of the Berlin University Alliance (BUA), we address questions of dynamism and persistence in the context of the persistent identification of research data.\nOur project benefits from the expertise of Jens Klump, Senior Principal Research Officer at Australia’s national science agency CSIRO, who is working as a BUA Fellow with our research group. Jens has extensive experience in this field, including contributions to the Research Data Alliance (RDA) Data Versioning Working Group (Klump et al. 2020), (Klump et al. 2021).\nOne question touching on the tension between the dynamic nature of data and the need for persistence on the side of infrastructures that can arise when dynamic research data is published in repositories is how these datasets should be recorded in publication management and research information documentation. Ensuring proper attribution of research performance for publishing dynamic datasets while addressing practical recording issues is a central concern of our project.\n\nTo facilitate a broad discussion with experts from academia, infrastructure, and administration, and to enhance the transfer of our work within Berlin’s research landscape, we hosted a workshop on June 28, 2024, at the Einstein Center Digital Future (ECDF) in Berlin. The event attracted around 40 experts from diverse scientific domains.\nAfter an introductory session, discussions focused on four key themes and the associated questions:\n\nRevision and Release:\n\nWhen do we differentiate between a revision and a release in research data management?\n\nTime Series and Dynamic Data:\n\nHow can we address the unique characteristics of time series and dynamic data in research data management?\n\nGranularity and Collections:\n\nHow does versioning support recording the provenance of an object?\n\nProvenance, Citation, and Metadata:\n\nHow should we handle provenance, citation, and metadata in the context of research data versioning?\n\n\nThese themes were discussed within the framework of the RDA’s work.\nLessons Learned\nIn a fruitful and lively discussion, we identified the following points\n\nRevision and Release:\n\nWhile many technological aspects of versioning are clear, definitional and coordination activities are still crucial. Establishing whether a change is a revision or a release requires developing conventions within user groups.\n\nTime Series and Dynamic Data:\n\nDifferent practices are necessary depending on the use case, such as ensuring traceability or allowing ongoing machine access to a dataset. Solutions should be tailored to the specific user groups.\n\nGranularity and Collections:\n\nProfessional requirements significantly influence granularity and collections, posing challenges for infrastructures that organize and provide access to these collections.\n\nProvenance, Citation, and Metadata:\n\nDiscussions highlighted the importance of metadata and evolving citation practices in facilitating dataset provenance. These practices are often shaped by disciplinary publication cultures and require infrastructure-level support.\n\n\nWe thank all participants for their enthusiasm and engaging discussions. The workshop offered a great platform for cross-institutional and cross-disciplinary dialogue, promoting valuable mutual learning.\nMany thanks to the BUA for their funding and to the ECDF for their hospitality.\nA workshop report in German is available (Klump 2024).

    "title": "Perspectives on the future of community-driven Open Access publishing",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The conversation about advancing the open access transformation has been revitalized by the “Council Conclusions on High-Quality, Transparent, Open, Trustworthy, and Equitable Scholarly Publishing” issued by the EU Science Ministries in May 2023 (Council of the European Union 2023).\nIn September 2023, we organized the conference “Community-Driven Open Access Publishing” as a satellite event of the Open Access Days 2023 (Bibliotheks- und Informationswissenschaft 2023).\nDuring the conference, we discussed ten statements on the future of community-driven open access publishing. An initial version of the statements had been drafted in German by the conference program committee between early March 2023 and the end of July 2023. Attendees had the opportunity to comment on these theses on the PubPub platform during the conference (Pampel et al. 2023). \nThe feedback collected on PubPub, at the conference, and on social media formed the basis for revising the statements, of which an updated version was published in April 2024 (Pampel, Bargheer, Bertelmann, Kaden, Wrzesinski, et al. 2024).\n\nTogether with Margo Bargheer, Roland Bertelmann, Ben Kaden, Maxi Kindling, and Dagmar Schobert, we have since then published an article in German about the development of the statements in the journal Bibliothek Forschung und Praxis (Pampel, Bargheer, Bertelmann, Kaden, Kindling, et al. 2024).\nTo mark the publication of the ten statements and also to broaden the conversation, this blog post documents the core elements in English: \n1. Bridging the strategic gap\nCommunity-driven publication infrastructures need backing from a comprehensive, large-scale strategy from research funding and infrastructure organizations. Only a high-profile initiative can ensure the necessary scientific policy support and financial commitment, thereby strengthening digital sovereignty in science.\n2. Acknowledging diversity in funding and business models\nCommunity-driven publication infrastructures require varied funding and business models tailored to the specific requirements of each (subject) community. This process should be guided by maximum transparency on costs and service portfolio.\n3. Strengthening libraries as publication service providers\nCommunity-driven publication infrastructures require a professional operation. Academic libraries, with their established services, expertise, and strong networks, are well-positioned to serve as active publication service providers for scholarly communities. Therefore, publication infrastructures within libraries should be systematically expanded.\n4. Ensuring quality, applying standards\nCommunity-driven publication infrastructures such as journals are responsible for maintaining the content quality of publications. This should be ensured using recognized quality assurance procedures that align with good scientific practice. Formal and technical quality assurance should be implemented by applying open publishing standards for both publications and processes.\n5. Strengthening collaboration with disciplinary communities\nCommunity-driven publication infrastructures need a strong foundation within scholarly subject communities and their organizational structures, such as learned societies. Collaboration should be participatory while allowing the publication infrastructures to remain autonomous. Libraries should engage more closely with subject communities and proactively shape services for the research community.\n6. Promoting experiments and innovation\nCommunity-driven publication infrastructures have the potential to shape innovations in scholarly publishing. Experimentation with new publication formats, further development of processes and standards, and exploration of new collaborative approaches should be encouraged.\n7. Ensuring sustainability\nCommunity-driven publication infrastructures require sustainable funding and business models. \nTo achieve this, a clear organizational integration is needed, a precisely defined mission and scope statement is essential, and funding organizations should express their commitment. Furthermore, the technical and legal sustainability of the infrastructures and their publications must be promoted by using open standards and open licenses.\n8. Orienting infrastructures towards the common good\nCommunity-driven publication infrastructures should focus on the common good and base their activities on the principles and values of the UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science (UNESCO 2021).\n9. Entering new collaborations\nCommunity-driven publication infrastructures should explore innovative collaboration models, operate across institutional and national boundaries, and aim to increase their visibility and that of their publications. Collaborations with external service providers can be advantageous, provided that governance remains aligned with scholarly interests.\n10. Implementing Open Science\nCommunity-driven publication infrastructures should enable the publication of texts, data, software, and other resources, and support the recognition of open science practices in research evaluation. To achieve these goals, they should operate openly and interoperably whenever possible.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Scholarly blogs can disseminate current research content quickly and beyond their own specialist community and put it up for discussion. Open communication without paywalls increases the visibility of scholarly research. Researchers as well as information infrastructure and cultural institutions therefore have an interest in supporting scholarly blogs as an Open Access publication format. But what can the individual actors do to strengthen and further develop scholarly blogs and how do scholarly blogs fit into current discussions about the science-led development of the Open Access transformation (Pampel et al. 2024)?\nDuring the workshop ‘Blogs as a blueprint for community-led Open Access publishing’ which took place as a part of the Open-Access-Tage 2024, the role of blogs within science communication was discussed using three statements (“Open-Access-Tage: Mittwoch, 11.09.2024” n.d.).\nThe workshop was organized and moderated by Evin Dalkilic from Verfassungsblog, Martin Fenner from Front Matter, Mareike König from the German historical Institute Paris, Catharina Ochsner from the Berlin School of Library and Information Science at the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin , Heinz Pampel, also from Berlin School of Library and Information Science as well as the Helmholtz Open Science Office and Ulrike Stockhausen from the Max Weber Foundation / de.hypotheses. The workshop was aimed at scientists, as well as information and publication professionals. The aims of the workshop were: to create a deeper understanding of the importance of scholarly blogs as an instrument of scholarly and science communication, to strengthen the recognition of their contribution to an open and sustainable research culture, and to identify needs for the further development of community-led open access publication infrastructures, based on the experiences of the participants (“Open-Access-Tage: Mittwoch, 11.09.2024” n.d.).\nTogether with the participants, statements on the following three topics were discussed: (1) workflow-related basic services, (2) networking services and (3) reputation management of scholarly blogs.\n\nDiscussion 1: Workflow-related basic services Statement:\n“Scholarly blogs must provide the same basic services as other forms of scientific publication: including PID assignment with relevant metadata, indexing in relevant catalogs, provision of full texts in various formats and long-term archiving.”\nA central topic in the discussion on thesis 1 was the question of the definition of scholarly blogs: What formats and content characterize ‘scholarly blogs’? Which components should be archived in the long term? This also raises the question of whether authors are interested in permanent availability. Since the role of blogs varies greatly depending on discipline, bloggers also have different requirements for their archiving. The format also raises the question of whether discussions and comments, which are important additions to the blog posts, should and can be archived. The participants emphasized that the responsibility for making blogs and their content findable, visible and accessible in the long term lies not only with the bloggers, but also with information infrastructure institutions.\n\n\nDiscussion 2: Networking services\nStatement: “Scholarly blogs are living networks and show research at its best: open, transparent, serious.”\nOnce again, the participants discussed issues relating to the definition and function of scholarly blogs and the quality assurance of content, as scholarly blogs are used for very different purposes and with different requirements - while some have their own editorial boards, others focus more on popular science communication. In the discussion, it became clear that quality assurance on scholarly blogs can be made possible primarily through openness and transparency (e.g. through versioning and comments). The connection of many blogs to research institutes or third-party funded projects also creates transparency and quality assurance. The possibility of low-threshold commenting and discussing content also contributes significantly to quality assurance (keyword: open peer review).\nWith regard to the quality assurance of scholarly blogs in comparison to the traditional scholarly publication landscape, the concern was also expressed that traditional publishing structures - such as gatekeeping by editorial offices and publishers- could be adopted in the blog landscape, although blogs should offer a more open format for scientific communication.\n\n\nDiscussion 3: Reputation management\nStatement: “Science blogs as a low-threshold, genuinely freely accessible and digital publication format are particularly suitable for reputation building.”\nQuestions of quality assurance, trustworthiness and scientific rigor were also discussed as part of the third statement. However, the answers to these questions also depend on the blog’s target audience. Should the interested public or the scientific community be addressed? The primary target audience has a decisive influence on how research is communicated and from whom recognition and reputation are expected. It was also observed that the reputation of blog posts depends on the respective blog and their discipline. Open peer reviews, e.g. through comment columns, were mentioned as a means of quality assurance, but consideration was also given to orienting oneself on existing quality assurance procedures for journals or other journalistic outlets. At the same time, blogs also offer the opportunity to break away from traditional publishers and establish themselves as an independent, academic publication format. In particular, blogs make it possible to develop and test new ideas. They often serve as a starting point for more extensive publications such as journal articles - which then also incorporate the discussions on the blog.\nConclusion Scholarly blogs offer a diverse format for presenting and discussing scientific ideas and research results at an early stage, flexibly and with a low threshold. They can serve as an independent publication platform for scholarly and science communication. Although quality and reputation can vary depending on the discipline and blog, scholarly blogs have the potential to establish themselves as a serious, open and transparent publication medium. Quality assurance, archiving and recognition represent a challenge that differs from traditional publications. In addition, very fundamental questions arise, such as the definition of scholarly blogs, i.e. their formal, technical and content requirements, or their function as a medium of science communication.\nUpdates and further information on the Infra Wiss Blog can be found on the Project Website On December 06, 2024, the project team at the Berlin School of Library and Information Science will organize a networking workshop in Berlin at the Einstein Center Digital Future (ECDF) in Berlin. The event will be held in German. Registration is possible here.

    "text": "Together with Christian Agi, Michael Beurskens, Marion von Francken, Judith Ludwig, and Bernhard Mittermaier, I have been working on recommendations for the inclusion of artificial intelligence in license agreements with publishers over the past few months. As part of the Task Force “Regulations on Artificial Intelligence in License Agreements,” within the focus area “Digitalization in Science” of the Alliance of German Science Organizations (Bertelmann et al. 2023), we addressed legal frameworks concerning permissions and prohibitions related to Text and Data Mining (TDM) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) under German law. Our work has led to recommendations for contract design. The recommendations are primarily intended for those negotiating license agreements with publishing service providers and those working with these contracts in libraries. It also indirectly benefits researchers who wish to use licensed content for TDM and AI applications. The recommendations are now available in both German (Agi et al. 2024b) and English (Agi et al. 2024a). The goal of the focus area”Digitalization in Science” is to identify the needs of scientists concerning digital infrastructures and services, engage in dialogue with relevant communities, develop practical expertise to support the scholarly work of Alliance organizations, and help shape the framework for digital research. The initiative is guided by principles that prioritize Open Access, while also ensuring sovereignty over data, tools, and infrastructures.

    "text": "I recently had the opportunity to speak on Deutschlandfunk about the Wayback Machine from the Internet Archive. The occasion was the recent cyberattack on the Internet Archive (Schräer 2023). The Wayback Machine plays a crucial role in preserving websites and providing access to our digital past—for researchers, journalists, and the interested public alike.\nThe preservation of other types of digital information is also important, for example the data researchers base their findings on. Together with colleagues, our team at the Berlin School of Library and Information Science at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, examined the ongoing operation of research data repositories. These repositories are of great importance to the scientific community, as they preserve data and facilitate data exchange among researchers. In our sample of 3,000 research data repositories, we found last year that repository shutdowns are not uncommon: 6% of the repositories we examined were no longer online at the time of our study (Strecker et al. 2023).\n\nThese findings, and the recent incident threatening the Wayback Machine, show that maintaining our digital heritage requires robust information infrastructures. Information Science research can contribute towards this goal by investigating threats to the availability of information resources.\nAs part of the Infra Wiss Blogs project funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG), we are currently working on assessing and ensuring the permanent accessibility of scholarly blogs (Pampel and Rothfritz 2024; Ochsner 2024).\nAnother part of the Deutschlandfunk program discusses the current copyright proceedings surrounding the Internet Archive.

    "text": "On December 6th, 2024, we hosted the first workshop of our project Infra Wiss Blogs (Ochsner and Pampel 2024), funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG). The aim of the workshop was to bring together scholarly bloggers and experts from information infrastructure institutions, so they could exchange experiences, wishes and challenges concerning scholarly blogs.\nIn the following, we give a brief overview of the workshop, the talks and discussions, and outline how we will continue our work following the results of the workshop. Following the welcome address, we presented the initial results of a survey of German scholarly blogs that we conducted as a part of the Infra Wiss Blogs project. Afterward, the workshop was enriched by multiple presentations around the topic of scholarly blogs and their long term accessibility.\nHenning Krause from the Helmholtz Association began with an overview of the Helmholtz Blogs, the blog portal of Germany’s largest research organization. He talked about challenges and opportunities with science communication, using blogs as an example.\nThis talk was followed by a presentation from Martin Fenner from Front Matter, on the topic of long term accessibility of scholarly blogs and the the Rogue Scholar blog archive.\nLastly, these presentations were followed by two inputs from practitioners within the field by Charmaine Voigt from GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences, and Britta Woldering from the German National Library. Charmaine Voigt presented the results of a survey on science blogs and podcasts at scientific institutions in Germany in the GESIS Wi⁴impact project. Britta Woldering introduced the work of the German National Library (DNB) in the field of web archiving and described the DNB’s approach to handling blogs for the permanent accessibility of digital content.\nThe available presentations of the speakers were published on Zenodo and can be found below:\n\nFenner, M.

Infra Wiss Blogs Vernetzungsworkshop 2024, Berlin. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14355206\n\nThe presentations and the results of the survey of German scholarly blogs were then discussed by the workshop organizers, the participants, and the speakers. To structure the discussion, we prepared a set of questions on the topic, e.g. “How can bloggers, libraries and archives work together to create standardized metadata and procedures for long-term accessibility for academic blogs?”. The main topic of discussion was how scholarly bloggers and infrastructure institutions can work together, to ensure the long term access of scholarly blogs.\nThe following challenges were identified concerning the standardization of scholarly blogs and their long term accessibility:\n\nInsufficient provision of metadata\nInsufficient licensing information\nDynamic contents, such as pictures or videos, comments, link rot pose technical and legal challenges\nBloggers’ lack of knowledge about the technical and legal requirements to ensure long term accessibility\nBlogs and other knowledge transfer and science communication activities are usually not adequately recognized in the scientific reputation system and the evaluation of research performance\n\nThe following strategies to enhance long term accessibility of scholarly blogs were proposed during the discussion:\n\n(Re-)using standardized formats (such as XML or JSON) that are already being used by blogs for the long term archiving\nIncluding licensing information into metadata. Recommended for use is the CC BY license\nLegal challenges of archiving comments could be solved through legal notice\nLibraries as educational institutions can help educate bloggers on blog requirements\nUniversities and other research performing organizations can support bloggers through offering platforms or better maintaining existing ones and by recognizing blogging as part of knowledge transfer and science communication\n\nThe discussion illustrated the diversity of the stakeholders. All participants agreed that there is a further need for stronger networking and collaboration on the topic. The participants also emphasized the need for support from universities and research institutions, as well as funding bodies, for their blogging researchers.\nThe workshop enabled us to bring together diverse perspectives from people involved in blogs, infrastructure, and science communication. We learned a lot and received numerous suggestions for the project.

    "text": "In my PhD research, I look at DataRescue or Data Refuge movements, for example through the work of the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative (EDGI) (“Environmental Data & Governance Initiative” n.d.) to understand how people respond when they fear data is at risk. I’m particularly interested in what these efforts reveal about how public data infrastructures actually work—not just as systems of information storage, but as objects of political struggle.\nThis research started quite some time ago with an overarching topic of trust and distrust in public data infrastructures (Rothfritz 2024a). I planned for the first iteration of the DataRescue movement to serve as a case study for this research (Rothfritz 2024b). Of course, I did not anticipate that there would be another series of events which would lead to the loss of access to public information and data in the U.S. so soon.\n\nRescuing Data\nIn 2016, a group of librarians, archivists, and environmental activists saw the writing on the wall: the incoming U.S. administration might threaten access to crucial federal climate data. What followed was a series of DataRescue events: community-led efforts to archive and preserve environmental datasets that many feared would be deleted, altered, or buried in bureaucratic obscurity (Janz 2017; Currie and Paris 2018)\nFast forward to 2025. Another major political shift is unfolding in the U.S., and with it, new concerns about the integrity and accessibility of public data. This time around, large amounts of public federal information such as websites (Singer 2025) and data (Koebler 2025) are disappearing from public access again. The scale and breadth of which kind of information is disappearing is arguably larger though - it concerns not just environmental data and climate change mentions on websites, but also for example health data and information from the Centers for Disease and Control Prevention (CDC) (Sun, Keating, and Nirappil 2025; Cox et al. 2025). Efforts seem to be more strategic and orchestrated.\nThe good news is that at least to a pretty far extent preparations were taking place before the Trump administration took office in January. For example, all federal websites were archived through the End-Of-Term Web Archive, a project which routinely has been doing this for administration changes in the U.S. since 2008 (“End of Term Web Archive” n.d.). A dataset of CDC data uploaded before January 28th, 2025 is available on the Internet Archive. EDGI and the Public Environmental Data Project have worked ahead to archive crucial environmental data (EDGI 2025).\nThere are quite a few other initiatives taking place at the moment. A good overview resource is collected through IASSIST on this Google Doc, which is constantly being updated.\n\n\nWhy This Matters\nPublic data infrastructures—the systems that store and provide access to government data—are often taken for granted. We assume that scientific reports, climate models, and environmental monitoring data will always be there when we need them. But these infrastructures are not just technical systems; they are deeply political. Decisions about what gets collected, what remains accessible, and what disappears are shaped by power, policy, and priorities.\nThe Data Rescue events of 2016–2017 brought together scientists, librarians, and civic tech communities to back up environmental datasets they feared could vanish under the Trump administration. At first glance, the movement looked like a technical project—downloading datasets, copying them to safer locations. But it was just as much an act of political resistance (Paris 2017).\nLooking back, one of the most fascinating aspects of Data Rescue is that very little data actually disappeared. Yet the movement wasn’t a failure per se, even though most of the rescued data was not usable and the collection was far from complete (Lamdan 2017). It revealed something crucial: it wasn’t just about saving data; it was about making government accountability visible (Dillon et al. 2017, 2019). One theory might be that the fact that people felt the need to take matters into their own hands showed a loss of trust in official assurances represented by federal infrastructures.\nNow, nearly a decade later, similar concerns are emerging. As the political landscape in the U.S. shifts once again. This time around,\nI am currently speaking with people who were in one way or another involved in the first DataRescue events. Some of them have continued to monitor federal data policies and website changes over the years. Their work is a reminder that data loss isn’t always dramatic—sometimes, it’s a slow erosion of accessibility, funding cuts, or subtle changes to the language used in official reports.\nIf there’s one thing the past decade has taught us, it’s that data isn’t neutral and neither are the infrastructures they are connected to. Public data infrastructures are shaped by politics, and in turn, they shape what we know about the world. Understanding how these systems work—and how they can be protected—will be critical in the years ahead.\nFurther information about the research group can be found on our official website.\nThis text – excluding quotes and otherwise labelled parts – is licensed under the CC BY 4.0 DEED.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n“CDC Datasets Uploaded Before January 28th, 2025 : Centers for Disease Control and Prevention : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming.” n.d.

Gleichzeitig betonte sie, dass flächendeckende Monitoringaktivitäten noch fehlten. In dieser Phase der Open-Access-Transformation sei eine aktivere Rolle der Leitungsebenen sowie eine stärkere Vernetzung zwischen Einrichtungen erforderlich. Auf die Herausforderungen bei der Etablierung von Informationsbudgets angesprochen verwies sie auf erhebliche Hürden, stellte aber auch die strukturbildenden Effekte von Programmen wie Open-Access-Publikationskosten der DFG und von DEAL heraus.

    "text": "Open Access Dashboard Collection Launched\nAs Open Access becomes increasingly central to scholarship and science policy, understanding the proportion of open publications within the overall publication output, whether at the level of research-performing organizations, individual countries, or globally, is gaining importance.\nIn recent years, an increasing number of dashboards have been created to track different facets of Open Access. Yet, a comprehensive overview of these tools has been missing. In our project OA Datenpraxis (Data Practice for Shaping the Open Access Transformation – Analysis, Recommendation, Training & Networking), funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) (Pampel et al. 2024), we have spent the past several months engaging with this topic by systematically mapping and analyzing the current landscape of Open Access dashboards.\nWe conducted a survey in which we identified nearly 60 dashboards. To enable a structured description of these dashboards, we developed a dedicated metadata schema. This schema captures key characteristics such as data sources, their license, responsible organizations, the type of output they monitor and more.\nThe resulting Open Access Dashboard Collection is now available on the project website. The underlying metadata schema is also accessible there and open for reuse.\n\nWe aim to continue developing this dataset through an open and participatory process. We welcome suggestions for additional dashboards as well as ideas for further refining the dataset and its structure.\nAn editable version of the collection is available in a shared Nextcloud folder, where you can directly add your suggestions. For questions, feedback, or submissions, please contact us at: oa-datenpraxis-dashboards@listserv.dfn.de. We look forward to hearing from you!\nThe project OA Datenpraxis supports the development of infrastructures for the open access transformation at research institutions in Germany. It focuses on promoting and establishing sovereign data practices to shape and manage this transformation effectively.\nFurther information about the project can be found on the project website.\nThis text – excluding quotes and otherwise labeled parts – is licensed under the CC BY 4.0 DEED.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nPampel, Heinz, Najko Jahn, Roland Bertelmann, Wolfram Horstmann, Laura Rothfritz, Lea Maria Ferguson, Birgit Schmidt, and Anna Stisser. 2024. “Datenpraxis Zur Gestaltung Der Open-Access-Transformation - Analyse, Empfehlung, Training & Vernetzung (OA Datenpraxis).” https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10794298.\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{pampel2025,\n  author = {Pampel, Heinz and Schneider, Johannes},\n  title = {Open {Access} {Dashboard} {Collection} {Launched}},\n  date = {2025-06-12},\n  url = {https://doi.org/10.59350/gj3rx-m5059},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nPampel, Heinz, and Johannes Schneider. 2025. “Open Access\nDashboard Collection Launched.” June 12, 2025. https://doi.org/10.59350/gj3rx-m5059."

    "text": "We are excited to share our first guide from the BMFTR-funded (Federal Ministry for Research, Technology and Space) project “Professionalisierung der Open-Access-Repositorien-Infrastruktur in Deutschland (Pro OAR DE)”: “Preprints: Handlungsfeld für institutionelle Open-Access-Repositorien” (German only.)\nMatthias, L., Pampel, H., Khamis, C. O., Rothfritz, L., & Wrzesinski, M. (2025). Preprints: Handlungsfeld für institutionelle Open-Access-Repositorien. Pro OAR DE Handreichung. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15603096\n\nThis publication stems from our November 13, 2024 networking forum on preprints and institutional repositories, which brought together 59 Open Access professionals from across Germany. The guide captures the collective expertise and insights generated during this collaborative event, offering practical recommendations to enhance how institutional repositories handle preprints.\nFollowing expert presentations by Lea-Maria Ferguson (Helmholtz Open Science Office) and Alexander Wagner (DESY), participants engaged in dynamic discussions in a “world café” format where they shared experiences and developed solutions to common obstacles. The presentation slides are available online.\n\nThe guide distills these rich discussions into actionable recommendations across five critical areas for repository managers:\n\n1. Policy for Preprints\nWithout overarching standards, institutions struggle with unclear definitions distinguishing publication types. Proposed solutions include establishing clear typological classifications at submission, setting explicit criteria for different preprint versions, implementing automated notification systems for updates, and creating robust links between preprints and their final published versions.\n\n\n2. Accessibility Workflows\nRepository managers face a complex web of challenges: the relationship between institutional and subject-specific repositories, technical representation issues, and limited researcher awareness about the strategic implications of preprints. Solutions include fostering cross-institutional dialogue, setting focused goals to reduce maintenance overhead, and providing comprehensive consultation services that empower researchers to make informed publication decisions.\n\n\n3. Versioning\nThree major barriers complicate version management: First, many repository systems simply lack versioning functionalities. Second, those with versioning capabilities must navigate the trade-off between merge approaches and split approaches. Third, authors have no obligation to report when their preprints are subsequently published, making it difficult to track version evolution. The community strongly advocated for early publication counseling and proactive author engagement to map out publication trajectories and develop appropriate pathways collaboratively.\n\n\n4. Disciplinary Diversity\nPreprint definitions and practices vary across disciplines, creating workflow complexities that require tailored solutions and generating reporting issues when publications appear across multiple platforms and stages. This diversity demands flexible approaches: facilitating faculty-level decision-making, establishing discipline-specific editorial networks for quality assurance, and emphasizing the critical role of high-quality metadata.\n\n\n5. Further Challenges\nCommunication barriers with publishers (particularly in the humanities), absent technical standards for metadata transfer and linking, and limited training opportunities for repository managers continue to hinder progress. Highlighted solutions include targeted outreach to academic communities, developing robust technical interfaces for better interoperability, establishing preprint policies with clear Persistent identifier (PID) recommendations, and expanding professional development programs both nationally and internationally.\n\nThis guide provides a foundation for continued professional exchange. Repository operators, libraries, and institutional decision-makers will find valuable insights for strategically embedding preprints within their institutions.\nWe extend our sincere thanks to all forum participants who contributed their expertise and experience to this collaborative effort. We welcome your feedback and look forward to continuing this important dialogue as we collectively strengthen the Open Access repository landscape.\nThe Pro OAR DE project continues with its sixth Networking Forum on July 7, 2025, focusing on “Compliance with Funding Requirements for Open Access.” We are delighted to welcome representatives from the European Research Council (ERC) and the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG), who will provide insights into their repository strategies and Open Access policies.

    "text": "In my PhD research, I investigate how metadata for research data are generated and maintained. I have started by analyzing how metadata records of the DOI registration agency DataCite change over time (Strecker 2024a, 2024b). Recently, I was awarded a grant by the Berlin University Alliance (BUA) - through the BUA Fellowship Program of the Objective 3 - Advancing Research Quality and Value. This grant will allow me to visit Stefanie Haustein, associate professor at the School of Information Studies at the University of Ottawa and co-director of the ScholCommLab. During my stay, I will investigate metadata flows in the context of research data. In particular, I will examine the transfer of metadata from local to global contexts.\n\nMetadata flows in the context of research data\nResearch data are typically deposited in research data repositories - infrastructures that specialize in handling this resource type. Metadata describing the datasets are also generated and maintained at these infrastructures. Numerous standards - metadata schemas - are used to describe research data (Asok et al. 2024; Koshoffer et al. 2018). Even within a discipline, the use of metadata schemas is not uniform (Mayernik and Liapich 2022). This variance arises because research data repositories create metadata for different use cases. On the one hand, metadata are needed to describe research data in a general and homogeneous way - for example, to enable data discovery in large search services. On the other hand, researchers need subject-specific metadata in order to be able to make an informed decision about whether they want to reuse a dataset (De Vries et al. 2022; Doran, Edmond, and Nugent-Folan 2021; Sostek et al. 2024). In order to cover this range of requirements, many research data repositories use several metadata schemas in parallel, e.g. the general DataCite metadata schema for DOI registration and a specialized schema adressing the needs of local users (Habermann 2023; Lee and Jeng 2019; Wu et al. 2023). In research data repositories, metadata are often initially generated based on a locally implemented, specific metadata schema. Metadata are then mapped to a general schema to meet global requirements such as DOI registration or harvesting (Habermann 2023). During these mapping processes, however, information from the original comprehensive description can be lost (Radio et al. 2017; Taylor et al. 2022). As a result, metadata lose completeness when they are transferred from local to global contexts (Mayernik and Liapich 2022).\nDuring the fellowship, I will investigate metadata flows from research data repositories to DataCite. The aim is to determine whether information that is missing in DataCite metadata are also missing in local contexts or would be available but are not transmitted.\n\n\nWhy this matters\nComplete metadata are necessary to convey the context of research data. This is relevant for many interactions with research data, including discovery, reuse and citation. Bibliometric research in particular is hindered by incomplete metadata, as is the development of metrics that are intended to reflect the impact of research data (Ninkov et al. 2021). This research will assess the potential of an approach to improve metadata quality - the optimization of mappings to the DataCite metadata schema.\nFurther information about our research group can be found on our official website.\nThis text – excluding quotes and otherwise labelled parts – is licensed under the CC BY 4.0 DEED.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAsok, Kavya, Sushree Snigdha Dandpat, Dinesh K.

    "text": "To support repository managers and institutional decision-makers, we are pleased to present our second guide from the BMFTR-funded (Federal Ministry for Research, Technology and Space) project “Professionalisierung der Open-Access-Repositorien-Infrastruktur in Deutschland (Pro OAR DE)”: “Forschungsinformationssysteme (CRIS): Handlungsfeld für institutionelle Open-Access-Repositorien” (German only.)\nMatthias, L., Pampel, H., Khamis, C. O., Rothfritz, L., & Wrzesinski, M. (2025). Forschungsinformationssysteme (CRIS): Handlungsfeld für institutionelle Open-Access-Repositorien. Pro OAR DE Handreichung. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15800262\n\nThis publication documents the outcomes of our December 11, 2024 networking forum on Current Research Information Systems (CRIS) and institutional repositories that brought together 67 Open Access professionals from across Germany. The resulting guide synthesizes the collective expertise and insights generated during this collaborative event, offering practical recommendations to enhance collaboration between institutional repositories and current research information systems.\nFollowing expert presentations by Daniel Beucke (Göttingen State and University Library) and Malte Kramer (CRIS.NRW), participants engaged in open discussions through a world café format, where they shared institutional experiences and developed practical approaches to common obstacles. The presentation slides from the expert talks are available online.\nThe guide distills these rich discussions into actionable recommendations across six critical areas for repository managers:\n\n1. Interoperability for Automated Data Flows\nThe participants identified essential prerequisites for successful interoperability. They emphasized that interoperability can only be guaranteed when the precise purposes of each actor and system are clearly defined as these purposes determine the required quality level, actual workload, and access authorizations for different data views (for researchers versus administrators) with appropriate granularity. This specificity is particularly important because interoperability exists in varying degrees, and the mapping of relationships must function bidirectionally between systems. Core challenges emerged around the standardization of metadata schemas, international connectivity through multilingual labels, and the consistent use of PIDs, particularly in the versioning of preprints. Attendees proposed several possible solutions. These included stakeholder involvement in determining responsibilities, clear guidance systems for data types, Linked Open Data, and regular quality management. Active participation in relevant networks and collaborative projects can further support these efforts.\n\n\n2. Repository and CRIS - Complementary Systems\nCritical organizational factors include the need for clear system definitions, the determination of a lead system, and the explicit institutional anchoring of responsibilities. Technical hurdles stem from diverse resource types and varying levels of metadata detail. The proposed solution begins with a comprehensive inventory analysis, followed by transparent assignment of responsibilities across departmental boundaries. The graphical representation of workflows was emphasized as a particularly valuable tool for communication among involved actors.\n\n\n3. Standards for Research Information\nInsufficient harmonization between the KDSF – Standard für Forschungsinformationen in Deutschland and library standards presents a significant obstacle, alongside further development of research evaluation criteria in the context of the Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment (CoARA) agreement. Participants identified consistent use of PIDs as a crucial technical prerequisite. CRIS systems show particular promise in adding value to the information budget through the systematic capture of publication costs.\n\n\n4. System Diversity and Isolated Solutions\nParticipants identified several barriers, such as insufficient user-friendliness, imprecise requirement profiles, inadequate data management, and limited system upgradeability. To address these challenges, they proposed establishing institutional networking and cooperation strategies guided by a dedicated steering group. In addition, they highlighted the precise definition of responsibilities and the strategic involvement of the institutional leadership. Resources emerged as a crucial factor, with particular emphasis on securing adequate IT competencies. This should be complemented by professional project management. The group proposed that user requirements should be systematically documented through user stories and discussed in an interdisciplinary manner.\n\n\n5. Diversity of Data - Publication Data and Other Research Information\nAt the organizational level, participants pointed to insufficient coordination as a central problem. This manifests in poor interdepartmental coordination, unclear responsibilities, and difficulties in collaboration. The situation is further complicated by the diversity of interest groups, different disciplinary cultures, and a lack of technical standards. To address these issues, participants recommended implementing a clear leadership strategy that meaningfully involves all stakeholders while precisely defining responsibilities. They placed particular emphasis on establishing ongoing dialogue with researchers, whose relief and support should be a central priority. The CoARA recommendations provide a valuable guiding framework for these efforts. From a technical perspective, participants advocated leveraging existing data sources like OpenAlex and adopting uniform data standards to enhance system interoperability.\n\n\n6. Further Challenges\nOrganizationally, complexities arise in coordinating repositories and CRIS systems, requiring close collaboration among different organizational units. Technical considerations demand preserving the autonomy of individual systems while simultaneously developing uniform standards for various entry types. The disciplinary dimension adds another layer of complexity, requiring careful consideration of different institutional workflows. Attendees recommended an approach combining several key elements, such as a thoroughly documented, professionally moderated development process, sustainable financing models that ensure long-term viability, and targeted training initiatives at the intersection of administrative and technical requirements.\nThis guide provides a foundation for continued professional exchange. Repository operators, libraries, and institutional decision-makers will find valuable insights for dataflows between institutional Open Access repositories and CRIS systems.\nWe extend our sincere thanks to all forum participants who contributed their expertise and experience to this collaborative effort.

    "text": "Leitfragen\nIm Zentrum des Hands-on-Labs stand eine intensive Gruppenarbeitsphase in Form eines World Cafés. Alle Teilnehmenden durchliefen drei moderierte Stationen, an denen konkrete Fragestellungen zur Verstetigung von Projekten diskutiert wurden. Die Ergebnisse wurden anschließend im Plenum zusammengetragen und werden im Folgenden dokumentiert.\n\n1. Wie gewinnt man interessierte Anwendende und baut eine aktive Community auf?\nEin zentrales Ergebnis der Diskussion war: Erfolgreiches Community-Building beginnt nicht erst nach dem Projektabschluss, sondern idealerweise bereits in der frühen Konzeptionsphase. Projekte sollten von Beginn an transparent kommunizieren, wer mitwirken kann, und möglichst niedrigschwellige Beteiligungsangebote schaffen. Kommunikation auf Augenhöhe und das ernsthafte Einbinden von Nutzer:innen in Entscheidungen, etwa durch Testphasen, offene Roadmaps oder partizipative Gremien, fördern die Identifikation mit dem Projekt. Als besonders wirkungsvoll wurden persönliche Kontakte, gezielte Ansprache über bestehende Netzwerke und die Nutzung von Testimonials genannt. Wichtig sei es, den konkreten Mehrwert für potenzielle Mitstreitende klar aufzuzeigen, z.B. durch Mitgestaltungsmöglichkeiten oder durch Hinweise darauf, was bei einem Scheitern der Infrastruktur verloren ginge.\n\n\n2. Welche Werkzeuge und Maßnahmen unterstützen den Aufbau einer stabilen Community?\nMit dieser Leitfrage wurden organisatorische und technische Instrumente zur Stärkung der Community adressiert. Genannt wurden u.a. kollaborative Plattformen für Dokumentation und Austausch (z. B. Wikis, Mailinglisten, GitHub), regelmäßige Online- und Präsenztreffen sowie modulare Governance-Modelle mit klar verteilten Rollen. Insbesondere Open-Source-Modelle wurden als förderlich für Transparenz und Mitwirkung angesehen – vorausgesetzt, es existiert eine koordinierende Stelle, die Beiträge moderiert und Entwicklungen konsolidiert. Die Diskussion zeigte auch, dass eine professionelle Projektkoordination entscheidend ist: Nur wenn Aufgaben wie Kommunikation, Dokumentation oder Support verlässlich übernommen werden, entsteht Vertrauen in die Verlässlichkeit der Infrastruktur. Communities benötigen Ansprechpersonen, die die Interaktion fördern, Feedback aufgreifen und Impulse für Weiterentwicklungen setzen.\n\n\n3. Was sind geeignete Organisations- und Rechtsformen für nachhaltige Strukturen?\nAuch die Frage nach passenden organisatorischen Rahmenbedingungen wurde diskutiert. Viele Projekte befinden sich im Übergang von informellen Strukturen zu formalen Organisationen – etwa in Form eingetragener Vereine. Die Diskussion machte deutlich: Eine Gemeinnützigkeit ist zwar wünschenswert (z. B. zur Mittelakquise), aber mit hohem bürokratischen Aufwand verbunden und oft schwer zu erreichen. Mitgliedsbeiträge allein decken die Betriebskosten in der Regel nicht; vielmehr setzen viele Communities auf Mischfinanzierungen – etwa durch die Einbindung von Ressourcen aus Trägereinrichtungen oder durch Kooperationsmodelle. Als vorteilhaft wurden konsortiale Strukturen und kooperative Netzwerke benannt, in denen Aufgaben arbeitsteilig verteilt und Ressourcen gemeinsam getragen werden. Dabei sei es zentral, Governance-Strukturen nicht nur effizient, sondern auch sichtbar und nachvollziehbar zu gestalten – z. B. durch Vorstände, Beiräte oder öffentliche Geschäftsordnungen. Gleichzeitig wurde betont, dass auch schlanke, projektnahe Strukturen funktionieren können, solange alle gemeinsam daran arbeiten, sich engagieren und organisatorische Aufgaben reihum übernehmen."

Erfolgsfaktoren sind frühzeitige Beteiligung, klare Verantwortlichkeiten, transparente Kommunikationswege und tragfähige Organisationsformen. Besonders betont wurde die Bedeutung gemeinsamer Werte wie Offenheit, Teilhabe und Verlässlichkeit, aber auch das Spannungsfeld zwischen Idealismus und Pragmatismus. Das Hands-on-Lab verstand sich als Auftakt für einen kontinuierlichen Austausch zum Thema.\nWeitere Informationen über die Forschungsgruppe Information Management an der Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin finden sich auf der [offiziellen Website] der Gruppe.

    "text": "I recently returned from a research stay at the University of Ottawa: A grant by the Berlin University Alliance (BUA) - through the BUA Fellowship Program of the Objective 3 - Advancing Research Quality and Value - allowed me to visit Stefanie Haustein, associate professor at the School of Information Studies at the University of Ottawa and co-director of the Scholarly Communications Lab.\n\nDuring my stay, I investigated how metadata describing research data flows from local to global contexts. I previously wrote about my research and why it matters on this blog (Strecker 2025). In the course of my stay, I was able to collect and prepare data for analysis. As a first step, I reviewed records of the registry of research data repositories re3data to check the status of OAI-PMH endpoints listed there. Next, I determined which endpoints expose metadata in specialized format using the RDA Metadata Standards Catalog, and checked which repositories have assigned DOIs to their resources. I selected 8 research data repositories - four from the social sciences and four from the geosciences. For each of these repositories, I retrieved metadata records based on (1) the specialized metadata schema, and (2) the DataCite Metadata Schema. The procedure I used ensures that these records describe the same resource, but in two different schemas. To prepare for the analysis, I updated and extended existing mappings between 3 specialized metadata schemas and the DataCite Metadata Schema. I am currently preparing a manuscript that will outline the results of this study.\nIn the six weeks I spent in Ottawa, I was also able to participate in another research activity - I contributed to a data collection initiative at the Scholarly Communications Lab that contextualized a recent suggestion by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the USA to cap APC funding. The data was initially used in a Science news article (Brainard, n.d.). After extending the dataset further to include more journals and articles, it was published (Haustein et al. 2025a) alongside two blog posts (Haustein et al. 2025b; The Scholarly Communications Lab 2025).\nI was also able to present my research to members of the Scholarly Communications Lab and University of Ottawa faculty members, and to discuss shared interests throughout my stay. Prof. Haustein also invited me to contribute materials on metadata for research data to a knowledge organization course.\nThe stay was very beneficial to my research. I was able to explore my chosen topic in depth and establish contact with colleagues that share my interests. I would like to thank the BUA for giving me this opportunity, and Stefanie Haustein, the Scholarly Communications Lab and University of Ottawa faculty for the welcoming atmosphere.\nFurther information about the research group can be found on our official website.\nThis text – excluding quotes and otherwise labelled parts – is licensed under the CC BY 4.0 DEED.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBrainard, Jeffrey. n.d. “NIH Details Options for Limiting Its Payments for Open-Access Publishing Fees.” Science News. https://doi.org/10.1126/science.zrf8mfm.\n\n\nHaustein, Stefanie, Eric Schares, Juan Pablo Alperin, Flavia Camargo, Lisa Matthias, Lucía Céspedes, Constance Poitras, and Dorothea Strecker. 2025a. “APCs of 2,228 Journals Where NIH-Funded Authors Published in 2025.” Harvard Dataverse. https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/3XDMNF.\n\n\n———. 2025b. “NIH Explores Capping APCs: Let’s Look at the Evidence.” Scholarly Communications Lab  ScholCommLab. https://www.scholcommlab.ca/2025/09/03/nih-apc-caps/.\n\n\nStrecker, Dorothea. 2025. “BUA Fellowship: Metadata Flows in the Context of Research Data.” Research Group Information Management @ Humboldt-Universität Zu Berlin. https://doi.org/10.59350/wwwj7-4cm07.\n\n\nThe Scholarly Communications Lab. 2025. “Shaking up the Scholarly Publishing Market – Why Caps on APCs Could Backfire - Impact of Social Sciences.” LSE Impact Blog. https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2025/09/11/shaking-up-the-scholarly-publishing-market-why-caps-on-apcs-could-backfire/.\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{strecker2025,\n  author = {Strecker, Dorothea},\n  title = {Report from the {BUA} Fellowship: {Metadata} Flows in the\n    Context of Research Data},\n  date = {2025-10-03},\n  url = {https://doi.org/10.59350/fzz0a-wv919},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nStrecker, Dorothea. 2025. “Report from the BUA Fellowship:\nMetadata Flows in the Context of Research Data.” October 3, 2025.\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/fzz0a-wv919."

    "text": "I had the great opportunity to be part of the CERN-NASA working group “Infrastructure for Open Scholarship”. This working group was established following the 2023 CERN-NASA Summit “Accelerating the Adoption of Open Science”. As a result of the summit, a closing statement was published, outlining key areas of action for Open Science (Tananbaum et al. 2023).\nUnder the umbrella of the Open Research Funders Group (ORFG) and with financial support from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, key topics from the closing statement were further developed in working groups. One of these working groups focused on the advancement of open science infrastructures. Our working group has now published its results in the form of a set of recommendations for funding organizations (Arancio et al. 2024).\n\nExcerpt: “These recommendations for funders are accompanied by a set of principles for open infrastructure projects that complements the first set and aims to increase the quality of service provided to researchers and institutions. The group aims to emphasize that the principles for infrastructure initiatives do not have a prescriptive approach; instead, the goal should be to foster good practices in the field. This work intends to add and build on the corpus of work that has been undertaken globally in this area, some of which is referenced at the end of this document. As with any global framework, it will need to be regionally situated to ensure feasibility, efficacy, and sustainability in a diversity of contexts.”\nRecommendations for funding agencies based on a set of core principles were created. These principles encompass the topics of infrastructure in open scholarship policies, recognizing work, funding and support, capabilities, and transparency.\nMany thanks to Julieta Arancio for her effective and cooperative leadership of the working group, and to all participants for their openness.\nThis text – excluding quotes and otherwise labelled parts – is licensed under the CC BY 4.0 DEED.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nArancio, Julieta, Claudia Alarcón-López, Heinz Pampel, Sherry Lake, César Pallares, Esther Plomp, Miho Funamori, Tanja Friedrich, Emmy Tsang, and CERN-NASA Working Group \"Infrastructure for Open Scholarship\". 2024. “Science Funders: Commitments Towards Open Infrastructure,” June. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11444361.\n\n\nTananbaum, Greg, Chelle Gentemann, Kamran Naim, Christopher Marcum, Eric Emsellem, Eunice Mercado-Lara, Tanja Friedrich, et al. 2023. “Sowing the Seeds of Global Open Science Coordination,” November. https://doi.org/10.5281/ZENODO.10059154.\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{pampel2024,\n  author = {Pampel, Heinz},\n  title = {Recommendations for {Funding} {Organizations} on {Open}\n    {Science} {Infrastructures}},\n  date = {2024-06-11},\n  url = {https://doi.org/10.59350/n1143-h4119},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nPampel, Heinz. 2024. “Recommendations for Funding Organizations on\nOpen Science Infrastructures.” June 11, 2024. https://doi.org/10.59350/n1143-h4119."
