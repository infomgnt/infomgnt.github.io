<p>Scholarly blogs enable researchers to communicate their research results and research-related topics quickly and openly, initiate discussions and promote dialogue among colleagues and also between scholars and society. However, compared to traditional forms of scientific output, like journal articles, conference proceedings or monographs, blogs are not yet integrated into digital research and information infrastructures. This lack of integration poses the risk of information loss <span class="citation" data-cites="ochsner2025">(Ochsner et al. 2025)</span>.</p>
<p>To address these issues, as part of the <a href="https://infrawissblogs.org/">Infra Wiss Blogs</a> project, we held a virtual discussion bringing together bloggers and experts from information infrastructure institutions. The goal was to present and discuss the in the project developed <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ckTCisliAciC574pf7kkl1RiTVMMCdN_0wkkluJcofo/edit?usp=sharing">catalogue of requirements</a> for a cooperative information infrastructure regarding the long-term availability of scholarly blogs. The catalogue was based on 13 qualitative interviews with German scholarly bloggers, aimed at identifying their requirements for an information infrastructure for the long-term preservation of scholarly blogs. The discussion took place in two rounds. First, bloggers and representatives of infrastructure institutions were able to discuss the catalogue with their respective peers, followed by a discussion in plenary.</p>
<section id="bloggers" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bloggers">Bloggers</h2>
<p>From the bloggers’ perspective, the discussion focused strongly on usability, legal clarity, and lowering barriers to participation. Many participants emphasized the need for clearer and more practical guidance on metadata integration. While metadata is widely recognized as essential for discoverability and preservation, bloggers often lack concrete instructions and standardized templates. There was a strong desire for predefined metadata schemas, clear explanations of required versus optional fields, and technical solutions, such as plugins, that could automate parts of the metadata workflow. Bloggers also asked for support on the subject of licenses. Additionally, Participants brought up that archiving comments would be a challenge, since the commentator’s consent would need to be required.</p>
</section>
<section id="information-infrastructure" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="information-infrastructure">Information Infrastructure</h2>
<p>Infrastructure experts focused on technical and legal constraints. One key issue was versioning: it remains unclear when a change to a blog or post should count as a new version and whether versioning should happen at the level of individual posts or entire blogs. Additionally, versioning is not yet an established practice for bloggers. Participants agreed that feeds and protocols such as RSS or ActivityPub function mainly as distribution tools and are not suitable for versioning or preservation. Instead, archiving and version control should take place within the blog’s backend or content management system. Legal concerns were especially pronounced for comments, as archiving content from many different authors without clear licenses is difficult. In practice, this often requires contacting authors individually, which is rarely scalable.</p>
</section>
<section id="plenary" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="plenary">Plenary</h2>
<p>In the plenary discussion, participants debated the role of libraries. Some argued that libraries could take on a stronger publishing role by hosting blogs, managing licenses, and assigning identifiers such as digital object identifiers (DOIs). Others favored a more limited role in which libraries provide technical infrastructure while leaving editorial responsibility with bloggers. It was also noted that institutional bureaucracy often discourages bloggers from using institutionally hosted solutions. One participant emphasized that the decentralised nature of blogs is already a strength, rather than a weakness. They proposed that there is no need for new inventions, but rather that there is a great potential to reuse and extend existing infrastructures. To conclude, rather than aiming for perfect solutions, participants agreed that simplifying processes and lowering entry barriers should be the highest priority. We will use this feedback to update the catalogue of requirements that can be commented on until <strong>February, 27th 2026</strong>. Updates on the publication of the revised catalogue will be published in English on our <a href="http://hu.berlin/infomgnt">research group blog</a> and in German on the <a href="https://infrawissblogs.org/">project’s blog</a>.

<p>We are pleased to announce the publication of a new guide from the BMFTR-funded (Federal Ministry for Research, Technology and Space) project “Professionalisierung der Open-Access-Repositorien-Infrastruktur in Deutschland (Pro OAR DE)”: “Forschungsdaten: Handlungsfeld für institutionelle Open-Access-Repositorien. Pro OAR DE Handreichung” (available in German only).</p>

<p>This guideline summarizes the outcomes of the fifth networking forum on “Institutional Repositories and Research Data,” held on May 12, 2025, which brought together over 100 Open Access professionals from across Germany.</p>
<p>After an introduction by the project team, experts Melanie Lorenz and Kirsten Elger (GFZ Helmholtz Center for Geoscience Research) presented “Scholarly Literature &amp; Data Interlinking,” focusing on the Scholix standard that improves connections between scientific literature and research data. Beate Rajski and Oliver Goldschmidt (Hamburg University of Technology) presented “TUHH Open Research,” an integrated approach managing publications and research data in a single DSpace-CRIS-based system. Webinar participants then collaborated in thematic working groups, addressing common challenges between institutional Open Access repositories and research data as well as specific research data infrastructures. The presentation slides are available <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15395748">online</a>.</p>
<p>The guide consolidates these collective insights into practical recommendations organized around six essential areas for repository operations:</p>
<section id="common-technical-solutions-for-text-and-research-data-repositories" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="common-technical-solutions-for-text-and-research-data-repositories">1. Common Technical Solutions for Text and Research Data Repositories:</h3>
<p>Participants identified the development of shared metadata schemas and metadata exchange between different systems as fundamental challenges. To address this, they recommended clearly defining use cases before making technical decisions, aligning requirements with established standards, and clarifying organizational aspects, such as certification and trust-building.</p>
</section>
<section id="interaction-between-text-and-data-repositories" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="interaction-between-text-and-data-repositories">2. Interaction Between Text and Data Repositories:</h3>
<p>Key challenges arise from responsibilities being distributed across different organizational units (e.g., library and computing center), interoperability of various components, and the management of large data volumes. Participants recommended precisely defining requirements to determine whether an integrated or modular system is best, implementing consistent user guidance to reduce complexity, and establishing clear workflows for metadata cataloging.</p>
</section>
<section id="metadata-standards-and-criteria-for-interoperability" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="metadata-standards-and-criteria-for-interoperability">3. Metadata Standards and Criteria for Interoperability:</h3>
<p>While the DataCite metadata schema is a widely adopted standard,handling domain-specific metadata in generic repositories presents a particular challenge. Proposed solutions included creating internal guidelines and documentation, prioritizing long-term preservation, and recommending strategies to ensure compatibility with domain-specific infrastructures.</p>
</section>
<section id="pids-for-research-data-sets" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pids-for-research-data-sets">4. PIDs for Research Data Sets:</h3>
<p>Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) and Handles have become established persistent identifiers for research data, while ORCID and ROR serve authors and institutions respectively. Participants recommended enhancing automation for metadata processes, using Data Stewards to raise researcher awareness, engaging with existing PID initiatives, and improving the usability of submission platforms.</p>
</section>
<section id="data-preparation-processes-and-metadata-maintenance" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-preparation-processes-and-metadata-maintenance">5. Data Preparation Processes and Metadata Maintenance:</h3>
<p>Continuous metadata maintenance proved to be a pressing challenge, particularly given limited time and staff. Participants emphasized that automation cannot replace the need for sufficient personnel. They recommended using controlled vocabularies and ROR links for institutional affiliations, and proposed integrating data literacy directly into university curricula.</p>
</section>
<section id="additional-challenges" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="additional-challenges">6. Additional Challenges</h3>
<p>Participants noted that metadata without curation is often of insufficient quality, significantly limiting discoverability and reusability. At the same time, researchers face time pressure and desire rapid publication. Proposed solutions included using AI to support metadata enrichment and quality control, assigning reserved DOIs, and aligning with NFDI (Nationale Forschungsdateninfrastruktur) developments to benefit from shared standards and expertise.</p>
<hr>
<p>This guide provides a foundation for continued professional exchange. Repository operators, libraries, and institutional decision-makers will find valuable insights for establishing effective publication and cost monitoring workflows within their institutions.</p>
<p>We extend our sincere thanks to all forum participants who contributed their expertise and experience to this collaborative effort. We welcome your feedback and look forward to continuing this important dialogue as we collectively strengthen the Open Access repository landscape.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>Scholarly blogs are an important part of scholarly communication and enable researchers to communicate their research results and research-related topics quickly and openly, initiate discussions and promote dialogue among colleagues and also between scholars and society. In contrast to traditional forms of publication (such as journal articles or monographs), scholarly blogs face particular challenges in terms of their long-term availability and citability. Content can be lost due to technical changes and a lack of archiving strategies. In addition, there is often a lack of standardised procedures for making blog posts permanently findable and clearly citable. To close this gap, the Infra Wiss Blogs project has developed a catalogue of requirements for the integration of scholarly blogs into information infrastructures.</p>
<p>The catalogue of requirements is based on the results of a qualitative interview study conducted with German scholarly bloggers as part of the Infra Wiss Blogs project. The aim of the study was to determine the requirements of scholarly bloggers for an information infrastructure that makes scholarly blogs available and citable in the long term. The catalogue defines requirements that ensure that scholarly blogs can continue to exist in the long term as citable, verifiable and sustainable contributions to scholarly communication.</p>
<p>The aim of the event is to discuss and further develop the catalogue together with the community. The feedback from participants will be incorporated into a subsequent revision of the catalogue.</p>
<p><strong>The catalogue can be found and commented on here:</strong> <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ckTCisliAciC574pf7kkl1RiTVMMCdN_0wkkluJcofo/edit?usp=sharing">To the catalogue</a></p>
<p>We are looking forward to receiving comments and feedback until <strong>February, 27th 2026</strong>.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The Pro OAR DE project, running from September 2023 to August 2026, has dedicated the past two years to collaborating with German Open Access (OA) repository managers and and the global Open Science community to professionalize repository infrastructure.</p>
<p>On October 30th, 2025, following a series of six networking forums, we hosted a pivotal session marking the culmination of these efforts. The event brought together a technical roadmap for repository integration, concrete use‑cases, and a forward‑looking discussion on AI‑driven discovery and interoperability.</p>
<p><img src="https://infomgnt.org/posts/2025-12-10-integrating-open-access-repositories-into-the-broader-open-science-landscape/Blogpost_WS7.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>As the <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/12562">Confederation of Open Access Repositories (COAR) manifesto</a> states regarding the true value of Open Access:</p>
<p><em>“Each individual repository is of limited value for research: the real power of Open Access lies in the possibility of connecting and tying together repositories, which is why we need interoperability.” <span class="citation" data-cites="rodrigues_case_2011">(Rodrigues, Clobridge, and COAR Working Group 2: Repository Interoperability 2011)</span></em></p>
<p>This webinar embodied that insight, welcoming presenters Kyle Demes (OpenAlex) and Kathleen Shearer (COAR), with participation from 87 repository managers and OA professionals.</p>
<p>The slides from the session are available <a href="https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.17582061">online</a>.</p>
<section id="openalex-elevating-repositories-as-primary-sources" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="openalex-elevating-repositories-as-primary-sources">1. OpenAlex: Elevating Repositories as Primary Sources</h3>
<p><a href="https://openalex.org/">OpenAlex</a> where <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2780-0393">Kyle Demes</a> serves as Chief Operating Officer, is a comprehensive index of scholarly works and research information. It aims to aggregate the full spectrum of research outputs, i.e., publications, authors, institutions, funders, and topics, into a single, fully open resource.</p>
<p>Kyle shared the exciting news that OpenAlex now recognizes institutional repositories as primary data sources, representing a shift from treating them merely as secondary links to alternative versions of existing works. This allows OpenAlex to mint new records for repository content, even when those works are absent from other aggregators. Demes also highlighted OpenAlex’s commitment to Open Code, Open Data, Open API, and Open User Interface practices.</p>
<p><br>
This strategic pivot has fostered direct collaborations with major repositories, such as HAL (short for Hyper Articles en Ligne ‘Hyper Articles Online’) and Research Portal Denmark. OpenAlex is currently developing public “pipes” to ingest OAI‑PMH streams, thereby enhancing data curation and quality in accordance with <a href="https://guidelines.openaire.eu/en/latest/">OpenAIRE guidelines</a> for repository managers.</p>
<p>Demes emphasizes the importance of distinguishing scholarly from non‑scholarly content and providing precise publication‑type descriptors. He argued that robust internal quality‑assurance processes are vital to improving the usability of metadata for downstream applications. However, the platform faces ongoing challenges. According to Demes, a particularly concerning trend is that works previously labeled as Open Access are being closed again, necessitating the review of numerous records included in OpenAlex.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="coar-advancing-open-access-repositories">2. COAR: Advancing Open Access Repositories</h3>
<p>The Confederation of Open Access Repositories <a href="https://coar-repositories.org/">COAR</a> with <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8617-5781">Kathleen Shearer</a> as Executive Director, brings together 162 members and partners across 50 countries, uniting libraries, research institutions, and funding organizations in a global network.</p>
<p>Shearer spoke of COAR’s vision for an ecosystem of interoperable digital research objects that are dynamically versioned, searchable, amenable to text mining, and capable of near‑immediate dissemination. This ecosystem should support diverse post‑publication review models, recognize various contributorship roles, and integrate data, code, interpretations, preregistrations, data‑management platforms, and quality‑control mechanisms.</p>
<p><a href="https://coar-notify.net/">COAR’s Notify Initiative</a> exemplifies this vision by developing a decentralized framework that connects research outputs with external services, such as overlay journals and open‑peer‑review platforms, through linked‑data notifications This has already been adopted by systems including DSpace, Harvard Dataverse, and EPrints.</p>
<p>Recent COAR projects highlight its commitment to enhancing repository functionality while maintaining openness. The organization’s July 2025 “Dealing with Bots” task force and its work on semantic multilingual searching address key technical challenges facing the repository community. COAR also promotes controlled vocabularies and Persistent Identifier (PID) interoperability through its PIDs Task Force, and a <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7108101">Community Framework for Good Practices</a> which directly benefit platforms like OpenAlex that rely on high‑quality repository metadata. The newly launched <a href="https://ird.coar-repositories.org/">International Repository Directory</a> (IRD) further enhances accessibility to the global repository network, addressing limitations of older directory services.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="converging-priorities-the-value-of-curation-and-interoperability">3. Converging Priorities: The Value of Curation and Interoperability</h3>
<p>OpenAlex and COAR share a fundamental commitment to rigorous curation and interoperability as cornerstones of effective open scholarly infrastructure. While OpenAlex focuses on ingesting and enriching repository metadata to build a comprehensive scholarly knowledge graph, COAR provides the normative and technical foundation that enhances this work. Through standardized vocabularies, PID coordination, best practice frameworks, its repository directory, and notification protocols, COAR creates the infrastructure that enables reliable and scalable metadata exchange. This synergistic relationship demonstrates how a well‑curated repository ecosystem can feed robust discovery platforms, ultimately advancing the broader mission of Open Science.</p>

Zenodo. <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17357984" class="uri">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17357984</a></p>
<p><img src="https://infomgnt.org/posts/2025-11-26-new-guide-on-publication-and-cost-monitoring/Blogpost_Monitoring_Handreichung.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>This guide documents the outcomes of our networking forum “<a href="https://www.ibi.hu-berlin.de/de/forschung/infomanagement/events/prooarde-monitoring">Publikations- und Kostenmonitoring mit institutionellen Repositorien</a>,” held on March 10, 2025, with 100 Open Access professionals from across Germany. Drawing on their collaborative work, the guide offers concrete, practice-based recommendations for advancing publication and cost monitoring through institutional repositories. Experts Dirk Pieper and Julia Bartlewski (Universität Bielefeld), as well as Colin Sippl and Gernot Deinzer (Universität Regensburg), presented concrete action options for publication and cost monitoring. Building on these presentations, participants worked together in a “world café” setting to share institutional experiences and develop practical approaches to common challenges. Presentation slides are available <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15056242">online</a>. The guide synthesizes these collective insights into practical recommendations organized around five critical areas for institutional repository management:</p>
<section id="definitions-of-publication-and-cost-data" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="definitions-of-publication-and-cost-data">Definitions of Publication and Cost Data</h3>
<p>Publication data encompasses all information about published scientific works, including authors, titles, abstracts, and persistent identifiers (PIDs) such as DOIs. Cost data refers to the financial aspects of publication, such as publication fees, processing fees, and value-added tax. The diversity of categories, lack of glossaries, currency, completeness, and inconsistencies between disciplines were identified as central challenges. Clear definitions and collection of these data are essential for effective monitoring. Different departments within an institution, such as libraries, finance departments, and university management, have varying requirements for this information. Close collaboration and regular communication are therefore crucial to establish efficient and transparent workflows.</p>
</section>
<section id="integration-of-external-data-sources" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="integration-of-external-data-sources">Integration of External Data Sources</h3>
<p>The integration of various data sources into repositories poses significant technical challenges. A fundamental issue is avoiding duplicates, which regularly occur during data aggregation from multiple sources. Services like OpenAIRE can help aggregate data and remove duplicates, though the completeness and effectiveness of these functions remain under continuous development. Another challenge involves integrating proprietary research information systems (CRIS). The lack of standardization and limited interoperability of these systems significantly complicate automated data exchange. Many steps still need to be performed manually, limiting both scalability and data quality. In addition to establishing standard interfaces, participants recommended the data service <a href="https://info.oa-deepgreen.de/en/">DeepGreen</a> for Open Access and secondary publications, noting that data verification workflows remain necessary.</p>
</section>
<section id="partners-for-cooperation-within-the-institution-and-beyond" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="partners-for-cooperation-within-the-institution-and-beyond">Partners for Cooperation within the Institution and Beyond</h3>
<p>Successful collaboration requires clear role descriptions and appropriate involvement of various stakeholders within the institution, such as faculties, libraries, IT departments, financial controlling, and other administrative units. Cross-institutional cooperation, including state initiatives, information infrastructure networks, and standardization projects, is equally important. Regular exchange with all stakeholders helps ensure that strategic considerations are coordinated and consistently developed. To this end, participants recommended the strategic selection of cost monitoring tools based on established standards and consistent alignment with best practices from other institutions.</p>
</section>
<section id="standards-for-monitoring" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="standards-for-monitoring">Standards for Monitoring</h3>
<p>Establishing uniform standards for recording and evaluating publication and cost data is essential. A controlled vocabulary for different data categories, such as cost and publication types, can improve the comparability of monitoring results. Projects like COAR and openCost offer promising approaches for developing such standards. Another complex area is the representation of costs for individual publications versus contract costs. Linking individual publications to overarching contracts poses an additional hurdle, particularly in transformative agreements where publication costs cannot be directly assigned to individual articles. To address the challenges posed by currently missing standards, participants recommended several practical solutions: systematic metadata comparisons between different sources, clear documentation of cost types, and the identification of net and gross amounts.</p>
</section>
<section id="workflows-within-the-institution-and-the-role-of-the-repository" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="workflows-within-the-institution-and-the-role-of-the-repository">Workflows within the Institution and the Role of the Repository</h3>
<p>Integrating publication and cost monitoring into existing institutional processes requires close cooperation between different stakeholders and departments. The use of different systems for various aspects of publication and cost monitoring, combined with heterogeneous cost data, pose central challenges. Participants recommended integrating all relevant functions into a single system, as this would make the processes significantly more efficient. The traditionally separate areas of cataloging, repository operation, and cost recording are gradually converging but remain far from full integration. Close cooperation between these areas for comprehensive cost and research reporting is seen as essential.</p>
</section>
<section id="additional-challenges" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="additional-challenges">Additional Challenges</h3>
<p>Beyond the challenges already mentioned, several additional issues can arise when implementing publication and cost monitoring systems. Communication with various stakeholders is often complex and can lead to uncertainties regarding fundamental questions, such as eligible publication costs and the role of the corresponding author. The continuous training of researchers and other involved parties also presents a challenge. Information events and training sessions are time-consuming to prepare and must be offered regularly. The high resource requirements for the comprehensive recording of all publications and their associated costs were also identified as challenges. The transition of cost management from Excel-based solutions to repositories or bibliographic systems poses a technical hurdle. Recommended solutions include direct presentations in scientific working groups, information offerings at events for early career researchers, and positioning as a central point of contact for publication-related matters.</p>
<hr>
<p>This guide provides a foundation for continued professional exchange. Repository operators, libraries, and institutional decision-makers will find valuable insights for establishing effective publication and cost monitoring workflows within their institutions.</p>
<p>We extend our sincere thanks to all forum participants who contributed their expertise and experience to this collaborative effort. We welcome your feedback and look forward to continuing this important dialogue as we collectively strengthen the Open Access repository landscape.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>On November 6 2025, we participated in the Workshop “Resilience in Times of Crisis: Strengthening Open Science Against Geopolitical Pressures” at the CWTS in Leiden.</p>
<p>The workshop made reference to the UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science <span class="citation" data-cites="noauthor_unesco_2021">(<span>“<span>UNESCO</span> <span>Recommendation</span> on <span>Open</span> <span>Science</span>”</span> 2021)</span>, which presented an extensive and inclusive vision for Open Science when they were published in 2021. In the geopolitical climate of 2025, the values in the UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science are threatened. Throughout the day, 20-30 participants discussed influences of geopolitics on Open Science, areas that require (more) awareness, and strategies to make Open Science more resilient.</p>
<p>In her keynote, <a href="https://www.library.upenn.edu/staff/lynda-kellam">Lynda Kellam</a> from the University of Pennsylvania Libraries introduced the <a href="https://www.datarescueproject.org">Data Rescue Project</a>. Following the keynote, invited speakers offered their thoughts on the resilience of Open Science practices and infrastructures. <a href="https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/en/persons/hugh-shanahan/">Hugh Shanahan</a> from Royal Holloway, University of London talked about factors that can put preprint servers at risk: the strong involvement of US institutions and a reliance on commercial internet service providers. <a href="https://www.molly-hardy.com">Molly Hardy</a> from the Library Innovation Lab at Harvard Law School introduced the <a href="https://lil.law.harvard.edu/our-work/public-data-project/">Public Data Project</a>, which applies curation practices to data rescue initiatives. <a href="https://www.ibi.hu-berlin.de/de/forschung/infomanagement/teaminfomanagement">Laura Rothfritz</a> from our research group at the Berlin School of Library and Information Science at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin presented results from her PhD thesis on the Data Rescue movement in 2017 and 2018 - read more about her contribution below. <a href="https://geotraces-gp15.com/joseph-gum/">Joseph Gum</a> discussed potential business models of open data infrastructures and risks associated with them. He also presented the <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15208172">Repository Crisis Scorecard</a>, a tool that can be used to assess the resilience of a repository during a crisis. <a href="https://www.uu.nl/staff/JMBosman">Jeroen Bosman</a> from Utrecht University offered a categorization of threats to Open Science as well as strategies to increase resilience.

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="laura-rothfritz---rescuing-data-resisting-loss">Laura Rothfritz - Rescuing data, resisting loss</h2>
<p>In her lightning talk, Laura shared results from her PhD research <span class="citation" data-cites="rothfritzWhatHappensWhen2025">(Rothfritz 2025)</span> which focuses on the first Data Rescue movement in 2017/2018 and asked when actions that feel resilient actually build resilience. Drawing on interview material she has collected for her thesis, she framed earlier data rescue efforts as “emergency curation”, which she defines as a form of first aid data duplication. This practice offered relief from fears around supposed data deletion but often produced redundancies of datasets without their contextual information, leading to unsustainable data practices. In her research, and in this talk, she is making a point to stress the importance of the affective consequences this sort of data activism might have, defined as such by my interviewees. These consequences range from feeling empowered and regaining agency in (politically) taxing times, to overwhelm and burnout.</p>
<p>In her research, Laura proposes the concept of anticipatory maintenance, defined as a preventive, future-oriented form of (infrastructural) care that turns imagined disruption into present routines aimed at sustaining continuity under uncertainty. She argues that in large parts this is what both iterations of the Data Rescue movement, in 2017/2018 and 2024/2025 respectively, might be seen as. In line with Jackson <span class="citation" data-cites="jacksonRethinkingRepair2014a">(2014)</span> and Rubio <span class="citation" data-cites="rubioIntroductionAvowingFragility2025c">(2025)</span>, she draws on broken-world thinking, which can be defined as a mindset of thinking with fragility and treating it as a normal, relational condition we live with. If fragility is seen as ordinary, then resilience is not a set goal but should be understood as a practice that must continually be negotiated. This is where future-oriented anticipatory maintenance might help with feeling resilient and simultaneously building resilience.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce the publication of our third guide from the BMFTR-funded (Federal Ministry for Research, Technology and Space) project “Professionalisierung der Open-Access-Repositorien-Infrastruktur in Deutschland (Pro OAR DE)”: “Zweitveröffentlichung: Handlungsfeld für institutionelle Open-Access-Repositorien” (available in German only).</p>
<p>Matthias, L. Pampel, H., Khamis, C. O. &amp; Rothfritz, L. (2025). <em>Zweitveröffentlichung: Handlungsfeld für institutionelle Open-Access-Repositorien</em>. Handreichung. <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16810750" class="uri">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16810750</a></p>
<p><img src="https://infomgnt.org/posts/2025-11-06-institutional-repositories-and-secondary-publication/Blogpost_Zweitveröffentlichung_Handreichung.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>This guide documents the outcomes of our networking forum <a href="https://www.ibi.hu-berlin.de/de/forschung/infomanagement/events/prooarde-zweitveroeffentlichung">“Institutionelle Repositorien und Zweitveröffentlichung”</a> (Institutional Repositories and Secondary Publication), held on January 13, 2025, which brought together nearly 100 Open Access professionals from across Germany.</p>
<p>Experts Sonja Härkönen (Universität Augsburg) and Tomasz Stompor (Kooperativer Bibliotheksverbund Berlin-Brandenburg) presented concrete strategies for secondary publication. Webinar participants then collaborated in thematic working groups, exchanging institutional experiences and co-developing practical solutions to common challenges. The presentation slides are available <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14725629">online</a>.</p>
<p>The guide consolidates these collective insights into practical recommendations organized around six essential areas for repository operations:</p>
<section id="supporting-researchers" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="supporting-researchers">1. Supporting Researchers</h2>
<p>A central challenge identified was bridging the gap between researcher needs and library requirements, particularly regarding manuscript versions. While libraries typically work with Author Accepted Manuscripts (AAMs), researchers often prefer using the Version of Record (VoR) for secondary publication. Low awareness of institutional repositories awareness frequently prevents researchers from considering secondary publication altogether. Participants recommended strengthening the institutional presence of Open Access officers as central contact points, integrating Open Access topics into training programs, developing efficient workflows through connection with existing structures, and implementing automated notification systems for publication opportunities. Participants emphasized that secondary publication should not burden researchers but rather serve as a professional library service that minimizes administrative and technical effort.</p>
</section>
<section id="open-access-policies-of-funding-organizations" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="open-access-policies-of-funding-organizations">2. Open Access Policies of Funding Organizations</h2>
<p>Participants stressed the need for clear communication and comprehensible guidelines. They called for concrete frameworks for secondary publication, including a maximum embargo period of 12 months and use of the VoR. Sustainable availability should be ensured through long-term archiving in certified repositories. Given the inconsistent success with implementation, participants discussed whether stronger political mandates from federal and state governments could foster a more consistent Open Access landscape.</p>
</section>
<section id="publisher-open-access-policies" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="publisher-open-access-policies">3. Publisher Open Access Policies</h2>
<p>Participants identified core elements for transparent publisher policies: clear definitions of permitted secondary publication strategies, permissible manuscript versions and publication venues, and precise specifications regarding embargo periods, licensing conditions, and citation requirements. For legal certainty, they recommended documenting each publisher policy through screenshots or PDF exports. Practical tools and direct publisher contact were also recommended. To optimize processes, participants suggested verifying upfront whether authors possess the required manuscript version. Active networking in the <a href="https://open-access.network/vernetzen/digitale-fokusgruppen/fokusgruppe-zweitveroeffentlichen">open-access.network focus group on secondary publication</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="workflows-and-opportunities-for-automation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="workflows-and-opportunities-for-automation">4. Workflows and Opportunities for Automation</h2>
<p>Participants emphasized aligning secondary publication processes with institutional priorities, particularly to promote Green Open Access. Technical solutions highlighted included open-source applications and automated interfaces to rights-checking platforms. For capturing publications, they recommended ORCID profiles, subject database exports, and specialized library tools. Participants prioritized standardization as a critical prerequisite for automation: routine procedures, email templates, and centralized documentation systems for publisher policies can significantly streamline workflows. They also recommended anchoring mandatory submission of accepted manuscript versions in institutional publication policies.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-role-of-green-open-access-in-the-open-access-transformation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-role-of-green-open-access-in-the-open-access-transformation">5. The Role of Green Open Access in the Open Access Transformation</h2>
<p>Participants discussed resource challenges, observing that Gold Open Access tends to absorb most institutional capacity, leaving Green Open Access to be managed as a secondary priority. Nevertheless, some institutions reported successful Green publication pathways supported by technical solutions such as self-submission systems with rights transfer options and automated reminders. Despite declining significance due to transformative agreements, participants emphasized the strengths of the Green route: cost-free access would enable all institutions to participate in the Open Access movement, especially for older publications with restricted access. The increase in secondary publication could be strategically leveraged in future publisher negotiations, with the role of preprints considered in a differentiated, discipline-specific manner.</p>
</section>
<section id="reform-of-secondary-publication-rights" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reform-of-secondary-publication-rights">6. Reform of Secondary Publication Rights</h2>
<p>Participants called for secondary publication of publisher versions under short embargo periods with CC BY licenses. The current 12-month embargo period was criticized as too long, as was the difficult-to-verify 50% funding clause in the German Copyright Act (<a href="https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/urhg/__38.html">UrhG § 38 Abs. 4</a>). They recommended a multi-step approach to rights verification, systematic documentation of publisher policies, and interpreting them in favor of authors. Library and institutional leadership should be encouraged to actively utilize secondary publication rights, particularly given the difficulty of obtaining early manuscript versions in disciplines without established preprint cultures.</p>
</section>
<section id="additional-challenges" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="additional-challenges">7. Additional Challenges</h2>
<p>Participants identified technical challenges in the interaction between research information systems and repositories, particularly the need to distinguish between primary and secondary publications using metadata. Other core challenges included legal consultation, compliance with funding requirements, and the resource-intensive article acquisition process. Recommended solutions included increased networking for exchanging best practices, workflow automation, and adequate staffing capacity. Participants particularly emphasized the untapped potential of UrhG § 38 Abs. 4 and the need for systematic public outreach regarding secondary publication services.</p>
<hr>
<p>This guide provides a foundation for continued professional exchange on secondary publication practices. Repository operators, libraries, and institutional decision-makers will find valuable insights for developing effective secondary publication workflows that support both researchers and institutional Open Access goals. We extend our sincere thanks to all forum participants who contributed their expertise and experience to this collaborative effort. We welcome your feedback and look forward to continuing this important dialogue as we collectively strengthen the Open Access repository landscape in Germany and beyond. BTW: We just published a study in the Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology (JASIST): <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.70016" class="uri">https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.70016</a>. In this systematic review, we examine the key challenges institutional repositories face in advancing Open Access and supporting the dissemination of scholarly work. These include issues of strategic alignment, sustainable funding, staffing, technology, and researcher engagement. Our findings underscore the importance of integrating IRs with institutional strategies, strengthening professional and technical capacities, and ensuring consistent support to reinforce IRs as vital components of the Open Science ecosystem.

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Am 19. September 2025 führten die DFG-geförderten Projekte <a href="https://oa-datenpraxis.de">OA Datenpraxis</a>, <a href="https://www.opencost.de/projekt/">openCost</a> und <a href="https://www.transform2open.de">Transform2Open</a> gemeinsam den Workshop „Praktiken und Infrastrukturen des Open-Access-Monitorings“ auf den Open-Access-Tagen 2025 durch <span class="citation" data-cites="pampel_praktiken_2025">(Pampel et al. 2025)</span>. Nach einer kurzen Vorstellung der beteiligten Projekte diskutierten mehr als 30 Teilnehmende aktuelle Fragestellungen des Open-Access-Monitorings im Format World Café. Dabei wurden die folgenden Handlungsfelder in den Blick genommen: (1) die Stärkung der Standardisierung im Bereich des Monitorings, (2) die Förderung von Transparenzinitiativen in diesem Bereich, (3) die Weiterentwicklung der Nachnutzungsmöglichkeiten offener Daten – auch im Kontext der Barcelona Declaration.</p>
<p><img src="https://infomgnt.org/posts/2025-10-27-praktiken-und-infrastrukturen-des-open-access-monioring/oat.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<section id="standardisierung" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="standardisierung">Standardisierung</h2>
<p>An der Station „Standardisierung“ diskutierten die Teilnehmenden, welchen Herausforderungen sie im Hinblick auf die Vereinheitlichung von Prozessen in ihren Einrichtungen begegnen. Dabei zeigte sich, dass über klassische Publikationsformate hinaus auch weitere Objekte und Formen zunehmend relevant werden. Genannt wurden u. a. Konferenzbeiträge, die Publikationsgebühren in der Teilnahmegebühr enthalten, Einreichungsgebühren, Beiträge zu Diamond-Open-Access-Formaten sowie experimentelle Langform-Publikationen und Bücher im weiteren Sinne. Für letztere wurden zusätzliche Kostenaspekte wie Layout, Lektorat, Videoschnitt, Programmierung (z. B. für Publikationswebseiten), Archivierung oder Disseminationsgebühren hervorgehoben. Dies verdeutlicht, dass je nach Disziplin spezifische Erfahrungen und Bedarfe existieren, die für die Weiterentwicklung eines Metadatenstandards zur Erfassung von Publikationskosten berücksichtigt werden müssen. In Bezug auf die Kostendatenerfassung wurde deutlich, dass an vielen Einrichtungen noch erheblicher Unterstützungsbedarf besteht. Genannt wurden insbesondere die Herausforderung, Daten aus unterschiedlichen Quellen abzugleichen, die Weiterentwicklung bestehender Systeme oder Kostenmodule sowie Fragen des Rechtemanagements. Diskutiert wurde auch die Nutzung einrichtungsindividueller Tabellen und Formate, etwa im Kontext der Ablieferung an OpenAPC, sowie die Notwendigkeit, community-geleitet gemeinsame Standards für mehr Effizienz und Vergleichbarkeit zu entwickeln. Der Bedarf an Standardisierung wurde somit klar als Mittel zur individuellen Arbeitserleichterung und zur Bewältigung gemeinsamer Herausforderungen identifiziert. Dies unterstreicht zugleich die Relevanz, in der weiteren Projektphase von openCost verstärkt am internen Kostenmanagement wissenschaftlicher Einrichtungen zu arbeiten. Schließlich befasste sich die Diskussion mit der Frage, wie Publikationen zuverlässig als vertragsfinanziert identifiziert werden können. Hierbei wurde die Elektronische Zeitschriftenbibliothek (EZB) als möglicher Referenzpunkt für einrichtungsindividuelle Vertragsinformationen hervorgehoben. Diskutiert wurde, welche bestehenden Systeme bereits genutzt werden, welche Synergien möglich sind und wie sich Schnittstellen – etwa zu LAS:eR, FOLIO oder über API-Abgleiche – künftig bestmöglich gestalten lassen. Auch die Erwartungen an eine künftige Vertrags-Registry wurden thematisiert, insbesondere in Hinblick auf Funktionen, Zugriffsebenen und die Integration in bestehende Workflows.</p>
</section>
<section id="transparenz" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="transparenz">Transparenz</h2>
<p>Die Station „Transparenz“ lud Teilnehmende dazu ein, über Maßnahmen zur Förderung von Kostentransparenz an ihren Einrichtungen zu sprechen. Teilnehmende betonten, dass es zunächst wichtig sei, den Adressatenkreis der Transparenzinitiative zu definieren: Für wen und zu welchem Zweck soll Transparenz geschaffen werden, und auf welcher Ebene? Daraus können Anforderungen an die Datengrundlage abgeleitet werden, etwa die Aggregationstiefe. In den Gesprächen stellte sich heraus, dass Transparenzbestrebungen an den Einrichtungen variieren. Ihr Erfolg ist häufig abhängig von der Ausgestaltung der Zusammenarbeit der beteiligten Einheiten, beispielsweise ob die datensammelnde Stelle Einsicht in das Finanzmanagementsystem erhält. Teilnehmende berichteten, dass Transparenz als Steuerungsmittel von Hochschulleitungen gewünscht ist. Die Erfahrung zeigt, dass ein Auftrag der Hochschulleitung Bibliotheken dabei hilft, dezentrale Kosten zu erfassen; er kann jedoch auch für Spannungen zwischen der Bibliothek und Fakultäten sorgen. Teilnehmende betonen, dass Transparenz nicht nur zur Kommunikation nach außen wichtig ist - Transparenz über die Aufteilung der Kosten innerhalb der Einrichtung ist ebenfalls wichtig. Mit Blick auf die Transparenz seitens der Verlage stellten die Teilnehmenden fest, dass sich einige Verlage bereits um Transparenz bemühen. Preise alleine seien jedoch schwer zu beurteilen, ohne auch die Produktionskosten zu kennen und einschätzen zu können, z.B. welche Ausgaben für Marketing angemessen sind. In Verhandlungen wäre ein vollständiger Überblick über die informationsbezogenen Finanzströme einer Einrichtung ideal, Non-Disclosure-Agreements stehen dem jedoch entgegen. Teilnehmende stellten fest, dass Non-Disclosure-Agreements vermieden werden können, wenn dies Teil des Mandats in Verhandlungen ist, wie ein Beispiel aus der Schweiz zeigt.</p>
</section>
<section id="offene-daten" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="offene-daten">Offene Daten</h2>
<p>Im Mittelpunkt der Diskussion an Station 3 stand die Nutzung offener Datenquellen für das Open-Access-Monitoring, insbesondere im Hinblick auf Publikationsaufkommen und -kosten. Die Teilnehmenden tauschten Erfahrungen, Herausforderungen und Perspektiven für die zukünftige Nutzung aus. Dabei zeigte sich, dass offene Daten bereits vielfältig eingesetzt werden, ihre Qualität und Verlässlichkeit jedoch stark variieren. Einige Teilnehmende berichteten, dass an ihren Einrichtungen offene Datenquellen genutzt werden – zum Beispiel OpenAlex für das Publikationsmonitoring. Die Erfahrungen zeigen, dass die Nutzung von OpenAlex einige Limitationen mit sich bringt. So variiert beispielsweise die Abdeckung der Disziplinen. OpenAlex erfasst außerdem eine Vielzahl an Publikationstypen, was zu einem „Overreporting“ führen kann. Eine weitere Herausforderung stellt die Datenqualität dar; etwa erschweren fehlende Affiliationsangaben eine effektive Nutzung. Teilnehmende betonten zudem, dass OpenAlex nur aktuelle Verlagslistenpreise abbildet, nicht jedoch die tatsächlich angefallenen Kosten. Der Dienst ist daher für das Kostenmonitoring nicht geeignet. Weitere genutzte offene Datenquellen sind unter anderem Unpaywall, Crossref, Sherpa/Romeo, DOAJ, Wikidata, DataCite und DBLP (insbesondere für die Informatik). Einige Einrichtungen ergänzen offene Daten durch Verlagsdashboards oder Verwaltungsdaten, um ein vollständigeres Bild zu erhalten. Über die Diskussion zum Thema Datenqualität hinaus wurde auch die Veränderlichkeit offener Datenquellen thematisiert: Angemerkt wurde, dass Aktualisierungen der Daten eine Herausforderung darstellen können. Betont wurde jedoch das Potenzial offener Daten. Sie, so die Teilnehmenden, können wesentlich zur Transparenz, Vergleichbarkeit und Effizienz in der Open-Access-Berichterstattung beitragen – vorausgesetzt, ihre Qualität, Pflege und Integration in institutionelle Infrastrukturen werden weiter verbessert. Damit offene Daten im Monitoring künftig eine tragende Rolle spielen können, nannten die Teilnehmenden mehrere Voraussetzungen: die Verbesserung der Datenqualität und Standardisierung, die Nachvollziehbarkeit von Änderungen und die Einführung einer Versionierung, die Verknüpfbarkeit mit institutionellen Datenquellen, transparente Governance-Strukturen für die Pflege und Weiterentwicklung der Daten sowie eine Community-basierte Qualitätssicherung und den Austausch zwischen Einrichtungen über Nutzungsperspektiven.</p>
</section>
<section id="fazit" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fazit">Fazit</h2>
<p>Die Diskussionen an den drei Stationen verdeutlichten, dass die Komplexität von Open-Access-Modellen und Kostenstrukturen eine zentrale Herausforderung für das Monitoring darstellt. Zwar müssen organisatorische und technische Lösungen – wie die Etablierung geeigneter Workflows, die Zuweisung von Rollen oder die Anbindung von Schnittstellen – in jeder Einrichtung individuell umgesetzt werden. Zugleich wurde deutlich, dass alle Einrichtungen vor vergleichbaren Herausforderungen stehen, insbesondere im Bereich der Kostenerfassung. Daraus ergibt sich ein klarer Auftrag, gemeinsame Standards und Werkzeuge weiterzuentwickeln, die lokal angepasst werden können, aber dennoch einheitliche und vergleichbare Lösungen ermöglichen. Die Beiträge der Teilnehmenden zeigten auch, dass Zweck und Adressat*innen von Transparenzinitiativen definiert werden sollten, damit Maßnahmen zielgerichtet geplant werden können. Die Nutzung offener Datenquellen könnte durch Hilfestellungen zum Umgang mit Limitationen und zur Datenbereinigung gefördert werden. Für die drei Projekte OA Datenpraxis, openCost und Transform2Open wurden in dem sehr anregenden und informativen Workshop weitere Handlungsfelder für die weitere Arbeit identifiziert.</p>

<p>The Infra Wiss Blogs project by the Research Group Information Management was represented at this year’s <a href="https://open-access-tage.de/open-access-tage-2025-konstanz">Open Access Days</a> with the workshop “Scholarly blogs as an integral part of the open access landscape”. The workshop was organised by Catharina Ochsner and Heinz Pampel (<a href="https://www.hu-berlin.de/de">Humboldt Universität zu Berlin (HU Berlin)</a>, <a href="https://www.ibi.hu-berlin.de/de">Berlin School of Library and Information Science (IBI)</a> in collaboration with Björn Gebert (<a href="https://mittelalter.hypotheses.org/">Mittelalterblog</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.sub.uni-goettingen.de/sub-aktuell/">Niedersächsische Staats-und Universitätsbibliothek Göttingen</a>), Melanie Seltmann (HU, IBI) and Ulrike Wuttke (<a href="https://www.fh-potsdam.de/">University of Applied Sciences Potsdam, SeDOA</a>).</p>
<p>Guided by the question “How can science blogs be institutionally anchored as an integral part of the open access landscape?” participants examined the opportunities and challenges of institutionally linking scholarly blogs. Initial results from the Infra Wiss Blogs project were presented <span class="citation" data-cites="ochsner2025">(Ochsner et al. 2025)</span>. The aim of the workshop was to develop an understanding of the role of blogs as sustainable open access infrastructures, identify institutional challenges and develop solutions for the institutional integration of scholarly blogs in order to promote science blogs in the spirit of open access in a sustainable manner. This blog post documents the workshop from the organisers’ perspective.</p>
<section id="discussion" class="level1">
<h1>Discussion</h1>
<p>Based on two thesis participants discussed the role of scholarly blogs as open access tools.</p>
<section id="thesis-1" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="thesis-1">Thesis 1</h2>
<p><strong>Information infrastructure facilities must offer the possibility of archiving and persistent addressing of science blogs.</strong> On the one hand, participants emphasised that scholarly blogs are important for the visibility and accessibility of scientific content and should therefore be included in long-term archiving in a similar way to other forms of publication. On the other hand, participants pointed out that resources, responsibilities and technical standards still remain unclear. A recurring issue concerned the independence of bloggers. Many participants value the freedom to publish without institutional guidelines. Yet, it was also acknowledged that long-term archiving requires rules and processes. Scholarly blogs, described during the workshop as the “punk rock of publishing,” are spontaneous, independent, and unconventional—features not always compatible with formal requirements. Also, some bloggers wished to maintain a possibility to delete their posts in the future. As a possible solution, participants suggested plugins that make metadata easily reusable, among other things. Discussion also focused on which actors should be responsible for long-term availability: a mandatory deposit at the German National Library (DNB), state library repositories, consortia, or collaboratively maintained infrastructures. Federalism was identified as an obstacle in this context. Participants also opposed granting monopoly positions to single institutions, not least with regard to the researchers’ own academic journey from one institution to another, instead advocating for an independent infrastructure. Responsibility for the long-term availability of scholarly blogs was also assigned to scholarly blog platforms, in particular <a href="https://hypotheses.org/">Hypotheses</a>. According to the participants, these should develop an archiving strategy, also in cooperation with the German National Library (DNB). In contrast, those who host a blog themselves are responsible for its long-term availability, according to the participants.</p>
</section>
<section id="thesis-2" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="thesis-2">Thesis 2</h2>
<p><strong>Scholarly bloggers are encouraged to ensure that they comply with open science practices and FAIR principles.</strong></p>
<p>According to the participants, there were also differing perspectives on this topic. On the one hand, it was acknowledged that bloggers should bear a minimum degree of personal responsibility. On the other hand, the participants agreed that individual researchers could not be expected to have comprehensive technical or information science knowledge. The participants emphasised that the motivation of many bloggers lies primarily in making their topic accessible and bringing it into scientific discourse – not in systematically pursuing open science. According to the participants, libraries and information infrastructures could play an important role here: they could transfer skills, create technical frameworks and facilitate compliance with standards. Participants critically discussed the applicability of the FAIR principles <span class="citation" data-cites="FAIR">(Wilkinson et al. 2016)</span>. Since the FAIR principles were originally developed for research data, they are not a “natural fit” for blogs and would need adaptation, according to statements made in the workshop. In addition, participants pointed out that not all bloggers want to make their content interoperable or reusable – especially with regard to its use by Artificial Intelligence (AI) processes. Instead of rigid requirements, it was therefore suggested that specific guidelines for blogs be developed, based, for example, on the principles of good scientific practice (GWP) that also names blogs as a publication medium <span class="citation" data-cites="GWP">(Forschungsgemeinschaft 2025)</span>. The contributions also made it clear that blanket demands carry the risk of reinforcing existing inequalities among bloggers. According to the participants, many scholars have neither the time nor the technical resources to comply with complex standards. It therefore remains important to respect the autonomy of bloggers while providing low-threshold support services.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Scholarly blogs are already an important part of open science communication today: they create visibility, increase accessibility and enable a low-threshold form of scientific exchange. At the same time, numerous open questions arise with regard to institutional embedding, for example, questions about responsibilities, resources and technical standards.</p>

  <title>Report from the BUA fellowship: Metadata flows in the context of research data</title>
  <dc:creator>Dorothea Strecker</dc:creator>
  <link>https://infomgnt.org/posts/2025-10-03-Report-from-the-BUA-fellowship-Metadata-flows-in-the-context-of-research-data/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I recently returned from a research stay at the University of Ottawa: A grant by the Berlin University Alliance (BUA) - through the <a href="https://www.berlin-university-alliance.de/en/commitments/research-quality/forschung/fellowship/index.html">BUA Fellowship Program of the Objective 3 - Advancing Research Quality and Value</a> - allowed me to visit Stefanie Haustein, associate professor at the School of Information Studies at the University of Ottawa and co-director of the <a href="https://www.scholcommlab.ca/">Scholarly Communications Lab</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://infomgnt.org/posts/2025-10-03-Report-from-the-BUA-fellowship-Metadata-flows-in-the-context-of-research-data/Desmarais_Building.jpeg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>During my stay, I investigated how metadata describing research data flows from local to global contexts. I previously wrote about my research and why it matters on this blog <span class="citation" data-cites="strecker_bua_2025">(Strecker 2025)</span>. In the course of my stay, I was able to collect and prepare data for analysis. As a first step, I reviewed records of the registry of research data repositories <a href="https://www.re3data.org">re3data</a> to check the status of OAI-PMH endpoints listed there. Next, I determined which endpoints expose metadata in specialized format using the <a href="https://rdamsc.bath.ac.uk">RDA Metadata Standards Catalog</a>, and checked which repositories have assigned DOIs to their resources. I selected 8 research data repositories - four from the social sciences and four from the geosciences. For each of these repositories, I retrieved metadata records based on (1) the specialized metadata schema, and (2) the DataCite Metadata Schema. The procedure I used ensures that these records describe the same resource, but in two different schemas. To prepare for the analysis, I updated and extended existing mappings between 3 specialized metadata schemas and the DataCite Metadata Schema. I am currently preparing a manuscript that will outline the results of this study.</p>
<p>In the six weeks I spent in Ottawa, I was also able to participate in another research activity - I contributed to a data collection initiative at the Scholarly Communications Lab that contextualized a recent suggestion by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the USA to cap APC funding. The data was initially used in a Science news article <span class="citation" data-cites="brainard_nih_nodate">(Brainard, n.d.)</span>. After extending the dataset further to include more journals and articles, it was published <span class="citation" data-cites="haustein_apcs_2025">(Haustein et al. 2025a)</span> alongside two blog posts <span class="citation" data-cites="haustein_nih_2025 the_scholarly_communications_lab_shaking_2025">(Haustein et al. 2025b; The Scholarly Communications Lab 2025)</span>.</p>
<p>I was also able to present my research to members of the Scholarly Communications Lab and University of Ottawa faculty members, and to discuss shared interests throughout my stay. Prof.&nbsp;Haustein also invited me to contribute materials on metadata for research data to a knowledge organization course.</p>
<p>The stay was very beneficial to my research. I was able to explore my chosen topic in depth and establish contact with colleagues that share my interests. I would like to thank the BUA for giving me this opportunity, and Stefanie Haustein, the Scholarly Communications Lab and University of Ottawa faculty for the welcoming atmosphere.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Wie wird aus einem geförderten Pilotprojekt eine dauerhaft tragfähige Infrastruktur? Diese zentrale Frage stellten sich viele der Teilnehmenden des Hands-on-Labs „Vom Drittmittelprojekt über die Community zur etablierten Struktur – Erfahrungsaustausch und Erarbeitung von Empfehlungen“ <span class="citation" data-cites="arning_vom_2025">(Arning et al. 2025)</span> auf dem 9. Bibliothekskongress / der 113. Bibliocon in Bremen am 26.06.2025.</p>
<p>Unser Hands-on-Labs bot einen Rahmen für Austausch, Vernetzung und gemeinsame Reflexion mit dem Ziel, praktische Empfehlungen für die Verstetigung von Informationsinfrastrukturen zu entwickeln.</p>
<p>Ein gemeinsamer Bezugspunkt aller beteiligten Infrastrukturen ist ihre Förderung im Rahmen des Programms <a href="https://www.dfg.de/de/foerderung/foerdermoeglichkeiten/programme/infrastruktur/lis/lis-foerderangebote/vigo">„Verantwortung für Informationsinfrastrukturen gemeinsam organisieren“ (VIGO)</a> der Deutschen Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG). Dieses Programm wurde von der DFG eingerichtet, um dem weit verbreiteten Problem der mangelnden Verstetigung von Projektergebnissen entgegenzuwirken. Allzu oft bleiben Softwarelösungen und Services nach dem Ende der Projektförderung ohne institutionelle Anbindung und verschwinden – trotz intensiver Entwicklungsarbeit – aus der Community. Die Förderung im Rahmen des VIGO-Formats unterstützt gezielt solche Projekte, die nachhaltige Strukturen aufbauen wollen: mit einem Fokus auf Community-Beteiligung, organisatorische Verstetigung und langfristige Finanzierungsmodelle. Seit 2024 sind fünf Projekte aus dem Programm gestartet (<a href="https://www.kitodo.org">Kitodo e.V.</a>, <a href="https://rdmorganiser.github.io">RDMO e.V.</a>, das <a href="https://www.open-encyclopedia-system.org">Open Encyclopedia System</a>, <a href="https://infrawissblogs.org/">Infra Wiss Blogs</a> sowie <a href="https://www.zbmed.de/forschen/laufende-projekte/wau">WAU – Wissensmanagement AG Universitätsverlage</a>, deren Vertreter:innen das Hands-on-Lab mitgestaltet haben.</p>
<p>Nach einer kurzen Einführung in Ziel und Ablauf der Veranstaltung teilten Vertreter:innen dieser Communities ihre Erfahrungen und Ziele in prägnanten Impulsbeiträgen. Dabei wurden neben erfolgreichen Maßnahmen auch die Herausforderungen benannt, die sich beim Aufbau tragfähiger Strukturen ergeben, etwa bei der Wahl der Rechtsform, der Finanzierung oder der Aktivierung der Community.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kitodo.org/">Key to digital objects - Kitodo e.V.</a> Mission: Nachhaltige Weiterentwicklung der Digitalisierungssoftware Kitodo Maßnahmen: Vereinsgründung 2012, DFG-Großprojekt, Aufbau eines Entwicklungsfonds<br>

<section id="leitfragen" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="leitfragen">Leitfragen</h2>
<p>Im Zentrum des Hands-on-Labs stand eine intensive Gruppenarbeitsphase in Form eines World Cafés. Alle Teilnehmenden durchliefen drei moderierte Stationen, an denen konkrete Fragestellungen zur Verstetigung von Projekten diskutiert wurden. Die Ergebnisse wurden anschließend im Plenum zusammengetragen und werden im Folgenden dokumentiert.</p>
<section id="wie-gewinnt-man-interessierte-anwendende-und-baut-eine-aktive-community-auf" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="wie-gewinnt-man-interessierte-anwendende-und-baut-eine-aktive-community-auf">1. Wie gewinnt man interessierte Anwendende und baut eine aktive Community auf?</h3>
<p>Ein zentrales Ergebnis der Diskussion war: Erfolgreiches Community-Building beginnt nicht erst nach dem Projektabschluss, sondern idealerweise bereits in der frühen Konzeptionsphase. Projekte sollten von Beginn an transparent kommunizieren, wer mitwirken kann, und möglichst niedrigschwellige Beteiligungsangebote schaffen. Kommunikation auf Augenhöhe und das ernsthafte Einbinden von Nutzer:innen in Entscheidungen, etwa durch Testphasen, offene Roadmaps oder partizipative Gremien, fördern die Identifikation mit dem Projekt. Als besonders wirkungsvoll wurden persönliche Kontakte, gezielte Ansprache über bestehende Netzwerke und die Nutzung von Testimonials genannt. Wichtig sei es, den konkreten Mehrwert für potenzielle Mitstreitende klar aufzuzeigen, z.B. durch Mitgestaltungsmöglichkeiten oder durch Hinweise darauf, was bei einem Scheitern der Infrastruktur verloren ginge.</p>
</section>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="welche-werkzeuge-und-maßnahmen-unterstützen-den-aufbau-einer-stabilen-community">2. Welche Werkzeuge und Maßnahmen unterstützen den Aufbau einer stabilen Community?</h3>
<p>Mit dieser Leitfrage wurden organisatorische und technische Instrumente zur Stärkung der Community adressiert. Genannt wurden u.a. kollaborative Plattformen für Dokumentation und Austausch (z. B. Wikis, Mailinglisten, GitHub), regelmäßige Online- und Präsenztreffen sowie modulare Governance-Modelle mit klar verteilten Rollen. Insbesondere Open-Source-Modelle wurden als förderlich für Transparenz und Mitwirkung angesehen – vorausgesetzt, es existiert eine koordinierende Stelle, die Beiträge moderiert und Entwicklungen konsolidiert. Die Diskussion zeigte auch, dass eine professionelle Projektkoordination entscheidend ist: Nur wenn Aufgaben wie Kommunikation, Dokumentation oder Support verlässlich übernommen werden, entsteht Vertrauen in die Verlässlichkeit der Infrastruktur. Communities benötigen Ansprechpersonen, die die Interaktion fördern, Feedback aufgreifen und Impulse für Weiterentwicklungen setzen.</p>

<section id="was-sind-geeignete-organisations--und-rechtsformen-für-nachhaltige-strukturen" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="was-sind-geeignete-organisations--und-rechtsformen-für-nachhaltige-strukturen">3. Was sind geeignete Organisations- und Rechtsformen für nachhaltige Strukturen?</h3>
<p>Auch die Frage nach passenden organisatorischen Rahmenbedingungen wurde diskutiert. Viele Projekte befinden sich im Übergang von informellen Strukturen zu formalen Organisationen – etwa in Form eingetragener Vereine. Die Diskussion machte deutlich: Eine Gemeinnützigkeit ist zwar wünschenswert (z. B. zur Mittelakquise), aber mit hohem bürokratischen Aufwand verbunden und oft schwer zu erreichen. Mitgliedsbeiträge allein decken die Betriebskosten in der Regel nicht; vielmehr setzen viele Communities auf Mischfinanzierungen – etwa durch die Einbindung von Ressourcen aus Trägereinrichtungen oder durch Kooperationsmodelle. Als vorteilhaft wurden konsortiale Strukturen und kooperative Netzwerke benannt, in denen Aufgaben arbeitsteilig verteilt und Ressourcen gemeinsam getragen werden. Dabei sei es zentral, Governance-Strukturen nicht nur effizient, sondern auch sichtbar und nachvollziehbar zu gestalten – z. B. durch Vorstände, Beiräte oder öffentliche Geschäftsordnungen. Gleichzeitig wurde betont, dass auch schlanke, projektnahe Strukturen funktionieren können, solange alle gemeinsam daran arbeiten, sich engagieren und organisatorische Aufgaben reihum übernehmen.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="perspektiven-und-nächste-schritte">Perspektiven und nächste Schritte</h2>
<p>Die Diskussionen zeigten, dass der Weg von der Projektförderung hin zu einer verstetigten Infrastruktur kein Automatismus, sondern ein aktiver, oft herausfordernder Gestaltungsprozess ist. Erfolgsfaktoren sind frühzeitige Beteiligung, klare Verantwortlichkeiten, transparente Kommunikationswege und tragfähige Organisationsformen. Besonders betont wurde die Bedeutung gemeinsamer Werte wie Offenheit, Teilhabe und Verlässlichkeit, aber auch das Spannungsfeld zwischen Idealismus und Pragmatismus. Das Hands-on-Lab verstand sich als Auftakt für einen kontinuierlichen Austausch zum Thema.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The <a href="https://www.langenachtderwissenschaften.de">Long Night of Science (Lange Nacht der Wissenschaften - LNdW)</a> is one of the most well-known public science events in Germany, providing research institutions with a platform for science communication. During this annual event, researchers present their work to an interested and engaged public.</p>
<p>Our research group at the <a href="https://www.ibi.hu-berlin.de/de">Berlin School of Library and Information Science (IBI)</a> at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin participated in the Berlin event for the first time this year, joining the celebration of LNdW’s 25th anniversary <span class="citation" data-cites="pampel_wissenschaftliche_2025">(Pampel et al. 2025)</span>.</p>
<p>Through our affiliation with the <a href="https://www.digital-future.berlin">Einstein Center Digital Future (ECDF)</a>, we had the opportunity to collaborate with Friedrich Schmidgall, head of the ECDF Micro Factory, to develop a hands-on exhibit showcasing our research in the field of information management.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.digital-future.berlin/haus-der-digitalisierung/micro-factory/">ECDF Micro Factory</a> provides ECDF researchers with space and experimental formats to explore ideas and create solutions outside of traditional academic structures. It offers both conceptual and technical support for the development of tangible and digital objects, using prototyping methods ranging from paper and cardboard to mockups and 3D-printed materials.</p>
<p>Our goal was to convey key concepts of Information Management and Open Science practices in a playful and accessible way. In our initial discussions with Friedrich Schmidgall, we came up with the idea of an animated “data puzzle” titled Information Management for Open Science, designed to illustrate two central themes of our research.</p>
<p>Friedrich Schmidgall then transformed our idea into an interactive exhibit in the form of a physical puzzle and a projected animation.</p>
<p>The installation featured a tabletop puzzle illuminated by an overhead projector. At first glance, visitors saw only projected outlines on the table surface, indicating empty spaces for the puzzle pieces, each marked with a unique icon representing a specific subject of the “data puzzle”. The interactive experience invited participants to find physical puzzle pieces with matching icons and place them in their designated spaces. With each correct placement, a new segment of the larger “data puzzle” emerged, revealing subject-specific information and QR codes that linked to an identifier online. As the puzzle took shape piece by piece, the complete visualization gradually emerged, guiding visitors through concepts of information management with both visual and tactile exploration.</p>

</div>
<p>To enable this interaction, we fitted the nine laser-cut acrylic puzzle pieces with uniquely positioned magnets. These magnets interacted with Hall effect sensors embedded in the tabletop surface. Only correctly placed puzzle pieces aligned their magnet with a sensor, thus triggering the projection of the corresponding segment of the “data puzzle”. The sensors were connected to an <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino microcontroller</a> running <a href="https://github.com/firmata/arduino">Firmata</a>, communicating sensor data to a host computer through serial connection. Processing of the sensor data and projection control were handled by the programmable multimedia toolkit <a href="https://vvvv.org/">vvvv beta</a>. The vvvv patch also included a GUI that allowed fine-tuning of the projection’s position and scale, ensuring proper alignment even if the projector was not mounted perfectly.</p>

<p>We tested the <a href="https://www.langenachtderwissenschaften.de/programm/detail/51432">object</a> in various research contexts. In the first version, we used an abstract example unrelated to a specific research project. During the trials, we found that explaining the interplay between people, projects, research data, infrastructures, and other resources of scholarly work often required concrete, real-world examples. In response, our second prototype used developments in CRISPR gene editing as a case study, which, while more engaging, highlighted specific challenges in communicating aspects of Open Science in the life sciences.</p>

<p>We ultimately selected the <a href="https://mosaic-expedition.org/">MOSAiC expedition</a> as the central example for our installation, the largest Arctic research expedition in history. Its relevance to climate research and the use of a large-scale research infrastructure, namely, research vessel Polarstern, offered an ideal context for conveying fundamental concepts of Information Management.</p>
<p>The interactive “data puzzle” was first presented to the public at the opening of the Long Night of Science on July 13, 2025.</p>
<p>The photos in this blog post provide a few glimpses of the exhibit in action. We were thrilled by the remarkable interest it generated. Until close to midnight, we presented our work in rotating shifts. Since the object was not entirely self-explanatory, it sparked many engaging conversations that also gave us an opportunity to reflect on our own research.</p>

<p>To support repository managers and institutional decision-makers, we are pleased to present our second guide from the BMFTR-funded (Federal Ministry for Research, Technology and Space) project “Professionalisierung der Open-Access-Repositorien-Infrastruktur in Deutschland (Pro OAR DE)”: “Forschungsinformationssysteme (CRIS): Handlungsfeld für institutionelle Open-Access-Repositorien” (German only.)</p>
<p>Matthias, L., Pampel, H., Khamis, C. O., Rothfritz, L., &amp; Wrzesinski, M. (2025). <em>Forschungsinformationssysteme (CRIS): Handlungsfeld für institutionelle Open-Access-Repositorien. Pro OAR DE Handreichung.</em> Zenodo. <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15800262" class="uri">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15800262</a></p>
<p><img src="https://infomgnt.org/posts/2025-07-24-Guide-Published-Interplay-of-Institutional-Repositories-and-CRIS/FIS_Handreichung_Blogpost.jpeg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>This publication documents the outcomes of our December 11, 2024 <a href="https://www.ibi.hu-berlin.de/de/forschung/infomanagement/events/prooarde-cris">networking forum</a> on Current Research Information Systems (CRIS) and institutional repositories that brought together 67 Open Access professionals from across Germany. The resulting guide synthesizes the collective expertise and insights generated during this collaborative event, offering practical recommendations to enhance collaboration between institutional repositories and current research information systems.</p>
<p>Following expert presentations by <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4905-1936">Daniel Beucke</a> (Göttingen State and University Library) and <a href="https://orcid.org/0009-0004-2098-8076">Malte Kramer</a> (CRIS.NRW), participants engaged in open discussions through a world café format, where they shared institutional experiences and developed practical approaches to common obstacles. The presentation slides from the expert talks are available <a href="https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.14440151">online</a>.</p>
<p>The guide distills these rich discussions into actionable recommendations across six critical areas for repository managers:</p>
<section id="interoperability-for-automated-data-flows" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="interoperability-for-automated-data-flows">1. Interoperability for Automated Data Flows</h3>
<p>The participants identified essential prerequisites for successful interoperability. They emphasized that interoperability can only be guaranteed when the precise purposes of each actor and system are clearly defined as these purposes determine the required quality level, actual workload, and access authorizations for different data views (for researchers versus administrators) with appropriate granularity. This specificity is particularly important because interoperability exists in varying degrees, and the mapping of relationships must function bidirectionally between systems. Core challenges emerged around the standardization of metadata schemas, international connectivity through multilingual labels, and the consistent use of PIDs, particularly in the versioning of preprints. Attendees proposed several possible solutions. These included stakeholder involvement in determining responsibilities, clear guidance systems for data types, Linked Open Data, and regular quality management. Active participation in relevant networks and collaborative projects can further support these efforts.</p>
</section>
<section id="repository-and-cris---complementary-systems" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="repository-and-cris---complementary-systems">2. Repository and CRIS - Complementary Systems</h3>
<p>Critical organizational factors include the need for clear system definitions, the determination of a lead system, and the explicit institutional anchoring of responsibilities. Technical hurdles stem from diverse resource types and varying levels of metadata detail. The proposed solution begins with a comprehensive inventory analysis, followed by transparent assignment of responsibilities across departmental boundaries. The graphical representation of workflows was emphasized as a particularly valuable tool for communication among involved actors.</p>
</section>
<section id="standards-for-research-information" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="standards-for-research-information">3. Standards for Research Information</h3>
<p>Insufficient harmonization between the <a href="https://www.kerndatensatz-forschung.de/">KDSF – Standard für Forschungsinformationen in Deutschland</a> and library standards presents a significant obstacle, alongside further development of research evaluation criteria in the context of the <a href="https://coara.eu/">Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment (CoARA)</a> agreement. Participants identified consistent use of PIDs as a crucial technical prerequisite. CRIS systems show particular promise in adding value to the information budget through the systematic capture of publication costs.</p>
</section>
<section id="system-diversity-and-isolated-solutions" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="system-diversity-and-isolated-solutions">4. System Diversity and Isolated Solutions</h3>
<p>Participants identified several barriers, such as insufficient user-friendliness, imprecise requirement profiles, inadequate data management, and limited system upgradeability. To address these challenges, they proposed establishing institutional networking and cooperation strategies guided by a dedicated steering group. In addition, they highlighted the precise definition of responsibilities and the strategic involvement of the institutional leadership. Resources emerged as a crucial factor, with particular emphasis on securing adequate IT competencies. This should be complemented by professional project management. The group proposed that user requirements should be systematically documented through user stories and discussed in an interdisciplinary manner.</p>
</section>
<section id="diversity-of-data---publication-data-and-other-research-information" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="diversity-of-data---publication-data-and-other-research-information">5. Diversity of Data - Publication Data and Other Research Information</h3>
<p>At the organizational level, participants pointed to insufficient coordination as a central problem. This manifests in poor interdepartmental coordination, unclear responsibilities, and difficulties in collaboration. The situation is further complicated by the diversity of interest groups, different disciplinary cultures, and a lack of technical standards. To address these issues, participants recommended implementing a clear leadership strategy that meaningfully involves all stakeholders while precisely defining responsibilities. They placed particular emphasis on establishing ongoing dialogue with researchers, whose relief and support should be a central priority. The CoARA recommendations provide a valuable guiding framework for these efforts. From a technical perspective, participants advocated leveraging existing data sources like <a href="https://openalex.org/">OpenAlex</a> and adopting uniform data standards to enhance system interoperability.</p>
</section>
<section id="further-challenges" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="further-challenges">6. Further Challenges</h3>
<p>Organizationally, complexities arise in coordinating repositories and CRIS systems, requiring close collaboration among different organizational units. Technical considerations demand preserving the autonomy of individual systems while simultaneously developing uniform standards for various entry types. The disciplinary dimension adds another layer of complexity, requiring careful consideration of different institutional workflows. Attendees recommended an approach combining several key elements, such as a thoroughly documented, professionally moderated development process, sustainable financing models that ensure long-term viability, and targeted training initiatives at the intersection of administrative and technical requirements.</p>
<p>This guide provides a foundation for continued professional exchange. Repository operators, libraries, and institutional decision-makers will find valuable insights for dataflows between institutional Open Access repositories and CRIS systems.</p>
<p>We extend our sincere thanks to all forum participants who contributed their expertise and experience to this collaborative effort. We welcome your feedback and look forward to continuing this important dialogue as we collectively strengthen the Open Access repository landscape.</p>

<p>Scholarly blogs have established themselves as important platforms for making research findings and discourse accessible both within scientific communities and to the general public. Considering the changing social media landscape, the role of non-commercial infrastructures such as blogs or the Fediverse is becoming increasingly important. Blogs can also be seen as part of scholarly-led open access publishing <span class="citation" data-cites="ochsner2025">(Ochsner et al. 2025)</span>.</p>
<p>The long-term accessibility of blogs, especially outside of infrastructures such as <a href="https://de.hypotheses.org/">de.hypotheses.org</a>, is a challenge that has not yet been solved. Archiving dynamic content and comments is a technical and organisational challenge, especially when such content is cited in scientific articles or even court rulings (such as in the <a href="https://verfassungsblog.de">Verfassungsblog</a>). The hacker attacks on the <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> in the fall of 2024 furthermore underline the general fragility of digital sources <span class="citation" data-cites="ochsner2025">(Ochsner et al. 2025)</span>.</p>
<p>As part of the <a href="https://bid-kongress2025.de/">BID Congress 2025</a>, the Hands-on Lab ‘Libraries as Operating and Preserving Institutions for Scholarly Blogs’ took place on 26 June in Bremen. The lab was initiated by the project ’Infra Wiss Blogs – Kooperative Informationsinfrastruktur für wissenschaftliche Blogs‘ funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) <span class="citation" data-cites="ochsner2025">Pampel and Rothfritz (2024)</span>.</p>
<p>The aim of the Hands-on Lab was to bring together experts from the scholarly blogosphere and libraries to discuss the challenges and potential of scholarly blogs with regard to visibility, indexing and long-term accessibility. Using the World Café method, the participants discussed aspects such as technology, organisation and framework conditions for the sustainable safeguarding and visibility of scholarly blogs in moderated discussion rounds, with a particular focus on the role of libraries as potential supporting institutions <span class="citation" data-cites="ochsner2025">(Ochsner et al. 2025)</span>.</p>
<section id="these-1-metadaten-und-licenses" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="these-1-metadaten-und-licenses">These 1: Metadaten und Licenses</h3>
<p>The first thesis was: ‘For the long-term archiving of their publications, scholarly blogs must carry out the necessary preparatory work, such as maintaining metadata and issuing (open) licences.’</p>
<p>The discussion showed that there is often a lack of awareness of these requirements in the blog community. Although blogs are valued as a low-threshold form of communication, it is precisely this low-threshold nature that is in tension with requirements such as metadata maintenance, licensing and technical standardisation.</p>
<p>According to the discussion, the responsibility lies with the blogs or authors - for example with regard to clear licence declarations, clarification of copyright issues (e.g.&nbsp;for embedded images) or the uniform use of CSS classes to support automated import processes. In this context, infrastructure providers, such as libraries, are responsible for providing technical solutions such as plugins to import blog posts into their information systems, as well as providing low-threshold information services.</p>
<p>The extent to which nudging strategies could help to establish more sustainable practices was also discussed. The promotion of open licences was highlighted as a particularly relevant field of action in order to overcome legal challenges in subsequent use, for example in the context of archiving.</p>
</section>
<section id="these-2-cataloguing" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="these-2-cataloguing">These 2: Cataloguing</h3>
<p>The second thesis focused on the cataloguing of scholarly blogs: ‘The cataloguing of scholarly blogs presents libraries with new challenges, as they can only be catalogued to a limited extent using traditional cataloguing criteria.’</p>
<p>The discussion focused on how deeply blogs should be catalogued. The variety of formats - from individual posts and comments to multimedia content - as well as the often multiple authorship lead to uncertainties in library practice.</p>
<p>Technical aspects such as different platforms, software architectures or feed maintenance also make standardisation difficult. The possible use of web scraping or aggregators such as <a href="https://rogue-scholar.org">Rogue Scholar</a> was discussed. The debate was supplemented by considerations on the sustainability of file formats (e.g.&nbsp;PDF-A, HTML), legal categorisation and liability for international content. One thing became clear: A more systematic approach to librarian fields of action in dealing with blogs is needed.</p>
</section>
<section id="these-3-responsibility-and-infrastructure-institutions" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="these-3-responsibility-and-infrastructure-institutions">These 3: Responsibility and Infrastructure Institutions</h3>
<p>The third thesis to be discussed was: “The long-term archiving of scholarly blogs must no longer be treated as a secondary task of public institutions. If necessary, this task must be secured by community-supported platforms.”</p>
<p>This statement was met with broad approval. The focus was on the question of which community can take on this role. Examples from practice showed the commitment of regional depository libraries or specialised information services (FIDs). Several participants reported on ongoing initiatives in their institutions.</p>
<p>Web archiving services and federated models such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a> were discussed as technical solutions. There was consensus that there is a need for better mapping of existing actors, activities and data flows at the infrastructure level.</p>
</section>
<section id="concluding-discussion" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="concluding-discussion">Concluding discussion</h3>
<p>In the final discussion, the question of how a sustainable, community-supported archiving of scholarly blogs could be designed was discussed: centralised through a new software solution or decentralised through stronger integration of existing institutions?</p>
<p>There was a consensus that cooperative models are needed in which different actors take on different roles, for example in metadata management, storage or visibility. A systematic approach was proposed: who is already active, what infrastructures exist and how can a cooperative system be formed from them?</p>
<p>The potential of web archiving was emphasised, especially in combination with targeted metadata extraction. The idea of parallel archiving, by the DNB, discipline-specific FIDs or institutional repositories, met with broad approval.</p>
<p><a href="https://rogue-scholar.org">Rogue Scholar</a> was highlighted as an example of good practice. However, it also became clear that there is still considerable room for improvement in ensuring data flows, e.g.&nbsp;for linking archiving, cataloguing and referencing.</p>
<p>Another topic was the role of scholarly blogs in the reputation system. Some called for blogs to be made more visible and integrated into recognition mechanisms for research evaluation. Others emphasised the independence of blogs, analogous to preprints, but without identical rules.</p>
<p>This led to the central question of definition: When is a blog considered scientific enough? The Infra Wiss Blogs project applies a broad definition: Scholarly blogs can be understood as those blogs that are written by scholars or are concerned with scholarly topics. The participants also favoured an orientation towards relevance rather than formal scientificity.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>In the Hands-on Lab, there was overwhelming support for a distributed system with various technical and organisational solutions, supported by a committed, interdisciplinary community that takes responsibility for the maintenance and visibility of scholarly blogs.</p>

<p>In my PhD research, I investigate how metadata for research data are generated and maintained. I have started by analyzing how metadata records of the DOI registration agency DataCite change over time <span class="citation" data-cites="strecker_changes_2024 strecker_how_2024">(Strecker 2024a, 2024b)</span>. Recently, I was awarded a grant by the Berlin University Alliance (BUA) - through the <a href="https://www.berlin-university-alliance.de/en/commitments/research-quality/forschung/fellowship/index.html">BUA Fellowship Program of the Objective 3 - Advancing Research Quality and Value</a>. This grant will allow me to visit Stefanie Haustein, associate professor at the School of Information Studies at the University of Ottawa and co-director of the <a href="https://www.scholcommlab.ca">ScholCommLab</a>. During my stay, I will investigate metadata flows in the context of research data. In particular, I will examine the transfer of metadata from local to global contexts.</p>
<section id="metadata-flows-in-the-context-of-research-data" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="metadata-flows-in-the-context-of-research-data">Metadata flows in the context of research data</h3>
<p>Research data are typically deposited in research data repositories - infrastructures that specialize in handling this resource type. Metadata describing the datasets are also generated and maintained at these infrastructures. Numerous standards - metadata schemas - are used to describe research data <span class="citation" data-cites="asok_common_2024 koshoffer_giving_2018">(Asok et al. 2024; Koshoffer et al. 2018)</span>. Even within a discipline, the use of metadata schemas is not uniform <span class="citation" data-cites="mayernik_role_2022">(Mayernik and Liapich 2022)</span>. This variance arises because research data repositories create metadata for different use cases. On the one hand, metadata are needed to describe research data in a general and homogeneous way - for example, to enable data discovery in large search services. On the other hand, researchers need subject-specific metadata in order to be able to make an informed decision about whether they want to reuse a dataset <span class="citation" data-cites="de_vries_flexible_2022 doran_reconciling_2021 sostek_discovering_2024">(De Vries et al. 2022; Doran, Edmond, and Nugent-Folan 2021; Sostek et al. 2024)</span>. In order to cover this range of requirements, many research data repositories use several metadata schemas in parallel, e.g.&nbsp;the general DataCite metadata schema for DOI registration and a specialized schema adressing the needs of local users <span class="citation" data-cites="habermann_connecting_2023 lee_landscape_2019 wu_analysis_2023">(Habermann 2023; Lee and Jeng 2019; Wu et al. 2023)</span>. In research data repositories, metadata are often initially generated based on a locally implemented, specific metadata schema. Metadata are then mapped to a general schema to meet global requirements such as DOI registration or harvesting <span class="citation" data-cites="habermann_connecting_2023">(Habermann 2023)</span>. During these mapping processes, however, information from the original comprehensive description can be lost <span class="citation" data-cites="radio_manifestations_2017 taylor_think_2022">(Radio et al. 2017; Taylor et al. 2022)</span>. As a result, metadata lose completeness when they are transferred from local to global contexts <span class="citation" data-cites="mayernik_role_2022">(Mayernik and Liapich 2022)</span>.</p>
<p>During the fellowship, I will investigate metadata flows from research data repositories to DataCite. The aim is to determine whether information that is missing in DataCite metadata are also missing in local contexts or would be available but are not transmitted.</p>

<p>Complete metadata are necessary to convey the context of research data. This is relevant for many interactions with research data, including discovery, reuse and citation. Bibliometric research in particular is hindered by incomplete metadata, as is the development of metrics that are intended to reflect the impact of research data <span class="citation" data-cites="ninkov_datasets_2021">(Ninkov et al. 2021)</span>. This research will assess the potential of an approach to improve metadata quality - the optimization of mappings to the DataCite metadata schema.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>How can scholarly publications be made more visible, discoverable, and interconnected? This question is the focus of a student practical project conducted as part of the seminar within the module Information Production and Management (BP3) in the summer semester 2025.</p>
<p>In close collaboration with colleagues from the <a href="https://www.museumfuernaturkunde.berlin/de/forschung/bibliothek">Coordination Office for Scholarly Publishing at the Library</a> as well as a research associate from the “Future of Collections” research area at the Museum für Naturkunde Berlin (MfN), the students are working on an exciting task: documenting scholarly journals in Wikidata from the fields of zoology, biodiversity research, and paleontology, including taxonomy and systematics of fossil organisms, enriching them with information, and linking them to each other.</p>
<p><img src="https://infomgnt.org/posts/2025-07-16-Connecting-Knowledge-with-Wikidata-a-practical-Project-with-the-Museum-fuer-Naturkunde-Berlin/mfn_visit.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>As part of this semester’s “Übung”, students received an introduction to Linked Open Data, with a particular focus on Wikidata. Especially for library applications, Wikidata is an exciting project because authorities, publications, and collections can be linked together, creating new opportunities for discovery, contextualization, and visibility.</p>
<p>The students worked with real datasets on the Museum für Naturkunde’s in-house journals <a href="https://zse.pensoft.net/">Zoosystematics and Evolution (ZSE)</a>, <a href="https://fr.pensoft.net/">Fossil Record (FR)</a> and <a href="https://dez.pensoft.net/">Deutsche Entomologische Zeitschrift (DEZ)</a>. Among other tasks, their work involved reviewing existing Wikidata entries, adding missing information, and linking relevant metadata (for example ISSNs, publishers, publication periods) with authority records such as the <a href="https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/">Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL)</a>, the <a href="https://gnd.network/Webs/gnd/DE/Entdecken/entdecken_node.html">Gemeinsame Normdatei (GND)</a>, or the <a href="https://viaf.org/de">Virtual International Authority File (VIAF)</a>.</p>
<p>The module at the Institute for Library and Information Science also included a visit to the Museum für Naturkunde, where students received a tour of the collections. This provided a hands-on introduction to working with real museum objects as part of their data-related assignments.</p>
<p>The edit-a-thon, embedded in a university seminar, demonstrated impressively the potential of structured, machine-readable data for digital science communication. Through the targeted recording and interlinking of publication data in Wikidata, new possibilities emerge for analysis and visualization. Tools like <a href="https://scholia.toolforge.org/">Scholia</a> already offer fascinating insights into topics such as “Top Topics through Time,” author networks, or gender ratios in science.</p>
<p>Examples from Scholia for individual publication periods of the three journals:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>ZSE (2008–present): <a href="https://scholia.toolforge.org/venue/Q15755646" class="uri">https://scholia.toolforge.org/venue/Q15755646</a></p></li>
<li><p>FR (2008–present): <a href="https://scholia.toolforge.org/venue/Q2455930" class="uri">https://scholia.toolforge.org/venue/Q2455930</a></p></li>
<li><p>DEZ (1954–present): <a href="https://scholia.toolforge.org/venue/Q403726">https://scholia.toolforge.org/venue/Q4037265</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>By systematically capturing article data from more than 160 years of publishing activity, a valuable resource is created for future research questions. Scholarly publications serve here as references and as data sources, but also as links to other entities such as groups of organisms, people, places, research expeditions, and collections (von Mering, 2024). The overarching goal is an open knowledge infrastructure for everyone, both researchers and the broader public. The Museum für Naturkunde Berlin will continue along this path with its own digitization initiatives and in collaboration with external partner projects.</p>
