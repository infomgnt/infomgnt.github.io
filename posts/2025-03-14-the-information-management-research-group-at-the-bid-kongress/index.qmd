We are pleased to announce that the projects [OA Datenpraxis](https://oa-datenpraxis.de/index.html) and [Infra Wiss Blogs](https://infrawissblogs.org/) of the [Information Management Research Group](https://www.ibi.hu-berlin.de/de/forschung/infomanagement) from the [Berlin School of Library and Information Science](https://www.ibi.hu-berlin.de/de) at the [Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin](https://www.hu-berlin.de/de) will be represented at this year's BID Congress. Furthermore, Heinz Pampel will be involved in several other events during the BID Congress.

# OA Datenpraxis

The Hands-on Lab titled ‘[Open-Access-Monitoring-Dashboards mit Quarto](https://bid2025.abstractserver.com/program/#/details/sessions/79)’ will take place on June 24th from 16:00–18:00 in Salon London. [Sophia Dörner](https://www.sub.uni-goettingen.de/kontakt/personen-a-z/personendetails/person/sophia-doerner/) will give a practical introduction to the development of a simple dashboard for the (open access) publication output of research institutions using Quarto, an open-source publication system. Previous knowledge of the R programming language or Quarto is not required, but helpful. Please bring a laptop and create a [Posit Cloud account](https://posit.cloud/plans/free) in advance.

The lecture titled ‘[Recording of publication costs at scientific institutions in Germany](https://bid2025.abstractserver.com/program/#/details/presentations/273)’ will take place on June 27th from 11 to 11:30 in the Focke-Wulf Saal. Dorothea Strecker, Heinz Pampel and Jonas Höfting will present the results of a survey conducted in 2024 as part of the OA Datenpraxis project. The survey investigated how data on publication costs are currently recorded at scientific institutions in Germany. Representatives of universities, universities of applied sciences, institutes of non-university research organisations (Fraunhofer Society, Helmholtz Association, Leibniz Association and Max Planck Society) and federal departmental research institutions were addressed.

# Infra Wiss Blogs

The lecture titled ‘[Mapping German scholarly blogs - results and impulses](https://bid2025.abstractserver.com/program/#/details/presentations/307)’ will take place on June 26th from 11 to 11:30 in Hall 4.1/Room II. Catharina Ochsner, Heinz Pampel and Jonas Höfting from the [Chair of Information Management](https://www.ibi.hu-berlin.de/de/forschung/infomanagement) of the [Institute of Library and Information Science](https://www.ibi.hu-berlin.de/de) at [Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin](https://www.hu-berlin.de/de) (HU Berlin), will present the results of a data collection of over 800 German scholarly blogs, which were analysed for infrastructural aspects. In addition, impulses will be given for academic libraries to make a contribution to ensuring the long-term accessibility of blogs.

The Hands-on Lab titled ‘[Libraries as operating and preserving institutions for scholarly blogs](https://bid2025.abstractserver.com/program/#/details/sessions/84)’ will also take place on June 26th from 2 to 4 pm in the Salon Oslo. In the hands-on lab, participants will discuss the role of libraries in the development, dissemination and preservation of scholarly blogs under the organisation and moderation of experts from the scholarly blog landscape. Aspects of technology, organisation and framework conditions for safeguarding blogs will be discussed in round tables. The Hands-on Lab will be led by [Catharina Ochsner](https://www.ibi.hu-berlin.de/de/forschung/infomanagement/teaminfomanagement) (HU Berlin) and supported by [Heinz Pampel](https://heinzpampel.de/) (HU Berlin), [Elena Di Rosa](https://verfassungsblog.de/author/elena-di-rosa/) ([Verfassungsblog](https://verfassungsblog.de/)), [Martin Fenner](https://front-matter.io/team) ([Front Matter](https://front-matter.%20io/)), Sven Ködel ([German Historical Institute Paris](https://www.dhi-paris.fr/home.html)), [Charmaine Voigt](https://www.gesis.org/institut/ueber-uns/mitarbeitendenverzeichnis/person/Charmaine.Voigt) ([GESIS: Leibniz Institute for Social Sciences](https://www.gesis.org/home)) and [Britta Woldering](https://www.dnb.de/SharedDocs/Kontaktdaten/DE/wolderingBritta.html) from the [German National Library](https://www.dnb.de/DE/Home/home_node.html). To register for the workshop, please send an E-Mail to Catharina Ochsner.
