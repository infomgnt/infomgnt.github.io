At last year's Open-Access-Tage, [OA Datenpraxis](https://oa-datenpraxis.de/en/) held a workshop together with the [Open Access Monitor](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/zb/open-science/open-access/open-access-monitor-1) at Forschungszentrum Jülich as well as the state-wide Open Access initiatives of Berlin ([Open Access Büro Berlin](https://www.open-access-berlin.de)) and Brandenburg ([Vernetzungs- und Kompetenzstelle Open Access Brandenburg](https://open-access-brandenburg.de/en/)). The workshop ‘The state and prospects of open access reporting’ outlined different approaches - qualitative and quantitative - to Open Access reporting and provided insights into examples for reporting procedures. Participants discussed opportunities and challenges of these reporting approaches in small groups before the results were briefly presented in plenary. The presentation slides have been published on Zenodo.

Recently, a new report documenting a workshop held by OA Datenpraxis and [Transform2Open]() at the 25th annual meeting of DINI (Deutsche Initiative für Netzwerkinformation e. V.) was published. Participants discussed how the costs of providing access to scientific information can be made more transparent.
