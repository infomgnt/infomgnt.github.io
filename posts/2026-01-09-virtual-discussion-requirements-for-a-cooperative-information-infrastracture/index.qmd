**Description:**

Scholarly blogs are an important part of scholarly communication and enable researchers to communicate their research results and research-related topics quickly and openly, initiate discussions and promote dialogue among colleagues and also between scholars and society. In contrast to traditional forms of publication (such as journal articles or monographs), scholarly blogs face particular challenges in terms of their long-term availability and citability. Content can be lost due to technical changes and a lack of archiving strategies. In addition, there is often a lack of standardised procedures for making blog posts permanently findable and clearly citable. To close this gap, the Infra Wiss Blogs project has developed a catalogue of requirements for the integration of scholarly blogs into information infrastructures.

The catalogue of requirements is based on the results of a qualitative interview study conducted with German scholarly bloggers as part of the Infra Wiss Blogs project. The aim of the study was to determine the requirements of scholarly bloggers for an information infrastructure that makes scholarly blogs available and citable in the long term. The catalogue defines requirements that ensure that scholarly blogs can continue to exist in the long term as citable, verifiable and sustainable contributions to scholarly communication.

The aim of the event is to discuss and further develop the catalogue together with the community. The feedback from participants will be incorporated into a subsequent revision of the catalogue.

**The catalogue can be found and commented on here:** [To the catalogue](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ckTCisliAciC574pf7kkl1RiTVMMCdN_0wkkluJcofo/edit?usp=sharing)

We are looking forward to receiving comments and feedback until **February, 27th 2026**.
