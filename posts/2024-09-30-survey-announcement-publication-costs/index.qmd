The Research and Teaching Group Information Management is conducting a survey on the topic of recording publication costs at research performing institutions in Germany. The survey is part of the project [OA Datenpraxis](https://oa-datenpraxis.de), which is funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG).

With this survey, we are investigating how research institutions record data on costs that may arise from the publication of research outputs by members of the institution.

Invitations are sent out to a total of 583 representatives of publicly funded Universities and Universities of Applied Sciences, institutes of the Fraunhofer Society, Helmholtz Association, Leibniz Association, Max Planck Society and federal departmental research institutes (see Figure 1).

The survey takes about 15 to 20 minutes to complete and can be filled out in German and English. Participating in the survey will help to promote transparency in the area of publication costs and is also useful for institutions that are not yet particularly active in this area. Results of the survey will be made available anonymously under an open license, and will be used to develop supporting materials.

Further information about the research group can be found on our [official website](http://hu.berlin/infomgnt).
