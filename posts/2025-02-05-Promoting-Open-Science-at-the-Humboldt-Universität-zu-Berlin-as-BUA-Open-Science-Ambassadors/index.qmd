The Ambassadors for Open Science program of the [Berlin University Alliance, BUA](https://www.berlin-university-alliance.de/index.html) aims to promote the knowledge and application of Open Science in various subjects. As Open Science experts and enthusiasts, the ambassadors show researchers, students and decision-makers at their institution how they can benefit from and make use of Open Science infrastructure [@berlin_university_alliance_auftakt_2024].

We are pleased to announce that [Dorothea Strecker](https://oa-datenpraxis.de/index.html) and [Catharina Ochsner](https://infrawissblogs.org/) from the Berlin School of Library and Information Science will serve as the Open Science ambassadors for the [Faculty of Arts and Humanities](https://www.hu-berlin.de/en/institutions/faculties-and-departments/fac-arts-humanities/standardseite) at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin (HU) until 31 July 2025.

The [Center for Open and Responsible Research (CORe)](https://www.berlin-university-alliance.de/commitments/research-quality/core/index.html) of the Berlin University Alliance (BUA) supports the ambassadors with financial resources for training and networking activities or for the organization of further education events for research colleagues, decision-makers and students [@berlin_university_alliance_open_2024]. We will announce future activities on our [lab blog](https://infomgnt.org/) and our [official website](https://www.ibi.hu-berlin.de/de/forschung/infomanagement/events). We are looking forward to hosting events as part of the Open Science ambassador program and to facilitate the adoption of Open Science practices at the HU.
