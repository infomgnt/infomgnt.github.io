I am pleased to share that our [research group](http://hu.berlin/infomgnt) is a partner of the [“Berlin – City of Open Knowledge for Academia, Administration, Civil Society & Culture”](https://www.berlin-university-alliance.de/commitments/research-quality/openx/berlin-stow/index.html) conference.

The conference will take place on October 23, 2025, from 9:30 AM to 4:30 PM, as part of the international [Open Access Week 2025](https://www.openaccessweek.org/).

This event will bring together experts, practitioners, and engaged citizens to explore the future of open knowledge-sharing in Berlin. Through a variety of interactive formats, participants will discuss strategies, present projects, and identify opportunities for cross-sector collaboration. A key element of the program is an Open Lab / Barcamp session, designed for self-organized discussions, project showcases, and idea exchanges.
