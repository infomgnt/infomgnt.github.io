However, missing from this archival literature are analyses about the political practice of preserving data as an act of grassroots resistance. Simultaneously, existing scholarly literature on grassroots data activism analyses the creation of new statistical representations to challenge official ones. This literature has largely ignored what will happen to this data over the long term, nor has it treated data archiving as an activist project in its own right. This theoretical article seeks to close the gap between literature on archival activism and literature on data activism, in hopes that both sets of research can draw productively from each other. There are clear affinities between activist archives and data activism: both address the failure by mainstream institutions to account for marginal voices, both have the power to make issues visible and legitimate within the public sphere, and both experiment with traditional forms of memory and statistical evidence. The authors believe that these two powerful forms of activity have much to learn from each other, particularly as the need to steward data over the long term will only grow.},

  abstract = {The Environmental Data and Governance Initiative (EDGI) was formed after the U.S. presidential elections in November 2016 to respond to the threat posed by the Trump administration to environmental data and policy, and to federal environmental agencies. During his campaign, Trump was openly hostile to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and to the science of climate change. Since taking office, Trump's administration has taken steps to radically de-fund federal environmental agencies and roll-back environmental regulations, threatening the public accessibility of federal environmental datasets and continued monitoring of environmental harms. The Trump administration has also taken down information from federal environmental websites, such as the EPA's web pages explaining climate change to kids. This situation poses specific challenges for environmental justice (EJ) activism, as many EJ organizations rely on federal datasets and information on environmental risks, industrial emissions, and climate issues. Since November 2016, EDGI has focused on preserving existing federal environmental data, monitoring changes to federal websites, documenting the political transition through interviews with staff at EPA and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and offering timely academic analysis of current events. Though EDGI's focus so far has been largely reactive to current political events, in this article we suggest a positive vision of ``environmental data justice,'' which we define as the public accessibility and continuity of environmental data and research, supported by networked open-source data infrastructure that can be modified, adapted, and supported by local communities. Environmental data justice also includes maintaining attention to long-standing EJ concerns about the politics of evidence, such as what counts as data, what data are collected, and whose interests they serve.},

This article offers the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative (EDGI) as a case study of one way to respond to this political moment. EDGI was started by a small group of Science and Technology Studies and environmental justice researchers and activists in the United States and Canada immediately after the November 2016 elections. Since then, EDGI has engaged in four primary activities: archiving Web pages and online scientific data from federal environmental agencies; monitoring changes to these agencies' Web sites; interviewing career staff at the Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration as a means of tracking changes within those agencies; and analyzing shifts in environmental policy. Through these projects and practices, EDGI members developed the concept of environmental data justice. Environmental data justice is deeply informed by feminist approaches to the politics of knowledge, especially in relation to critical data and archival studies. In this article we establish the theoretical basis for environmental data justice and demonstrate how EDGI enacts this framework in practice. Key Words: critical data studies, environmental data justice, feminist science studies, the politics of knowledge, social practice.},

  abstract = {This paper draws on archival theory to situate data- and web-mirroring as a form of community and activist archiving. To make this argument, the paper provides a case study of the recent, international DataRefuge effort as an act of activist archiving, one that acknowledges the role of decentralized data infrastructures to enable political resistance and the democratization of knowledge sharing.\&nbsp; Archival activism can emerge from political expediency or as a form of struggle, often by individuals working independently of any supported institution. In Nazi Germany, for example, individuals smuggled scholarly documents into protected archives, enabling future access to the works of Edmund Husserl, among others. Activist archives also surface in response to silencing and marginalization within hostile political environments. The Mazer Lesbian Archive accumulated in the 1980s as dedicated volunteers documented largely invisible lesbian culture. Both of these elusive collections found their way into institutions: Husserl's at the University of Louvain and the Mazer at UCLA.\&nbsp; Web mirroring of datasets draws from this archival trajectory but does not consolidate materials into one space. Rather, mirroring or web archiving is necessarily a decentralized activity. A recent example of such work is DataRefuge, whose goal is to disperse once-centralized, federal scientific climate data, documents, and webpages into an international patchwork of repositories, coordinated by in-situ tactics of web scraping, mirroring, and data harvesting. As information on federal websites have already vanished from public view under the new Trump administration, this preemptive, federated "guerrilla archiving" works to outpace any further changes.},

  abstract = {This lightning talk is based on an ongoing research for a doctoral thesis on trust, distrust, and mistrust within the realm of public data infrastructures. The research aims to unravel how societal circumstances, particularly the political climate, impact mistrust and distrust in these infrastructures. It delves into the complexities and differences between trust, distrust, and mistrust, with a primary focus on the development of mistrust and distrust in public sector data infrastructures. While previous studies have largely explored trust in data repositories and public data infrastructures, this research focuses on distrust and mistrust. Drawing from infrastructure studies, it places emphasis on the embeddedness of infrastructures within political contexts, exploring how individuals distinguish between their distrust in a political system and their attitudes toward the infrastructures embedded within that system. Trustworthy Digital Repositories (TDRs) are usually considered trustworthy, because they have been certified through auditing services (e.g. the CoreTrustSeal) and have substantial preservation plans in place. However, in times of contextual circumstances (e.g. political uncertainty) outside of the scope of certification, how can infrastructure providers really tell that their user community actually trusts them? This will be the main question posed during the talk. One exemplary case study explored in this ongoing research is the Data Rescue movement. In 2016 and 2017, the Data Rescue events, a series of hackathon-style gatherings, aimed to safeguard federal environmental data in the U.S., uniting scientists, information professionals, and activists across over 30 nationwide events. These initiatives responded to concerns about climate change denial and the perceived erosion of environmental protections under the Trump administration, inspired by similar efforts in Canada during the tenure of former Prime Minister Stephen Harper. While these events were lauded as examples of archival data activism, their impact revealed the vulnerability of federal data, primarily in terms of access, amidst budget constraints and staffing reductions. Remarkably, the movement fell short of creating a comprehensive archive, and no endangered data was actually deleted. This grassroots activism underscored that data management and archiving are inherently political activities. Additionally, it underscored how trust in public data infrastructures can falter and how mistrusting or distrusting data infrastructures lead to activities in the realm of data activism. Importantly, this research proposes that studying distrust and mistrust in infrastructures instead of focusing on trust and trustworthiness can significantly advance our understanding of the relationships between information infrastructures and their users, complementing existing misinformation studies. Furthermore, it suggests that considering mistrust and distrust can enhance stakeholder management and service provision within infrastructures. The lightning talk will share insights from this ongoing research and the implications for data infrastructure providers, as well as the broader implications for TDRs in politically uncertain contexts},

  abstract = {In the landscape of (Open) Science, the discourse on trust has been a cornerstone of discussions, emphasizing the importance of fostering reliability and credibility within scientific practices. However, I advocate for a view that extends beyond the emphasis on trust and to consider dynamics of mistrust and distrust in public data infrastructures. This proposal is rooted in the recognition that infrastructures, as complex socio-technical systems, not only facilitate the flow of information but can also act as recipients of system trust or system distrust. While existing research has predominantly examined trust in data repositories and public infrastructures (Yakel et al., 2013; Donaldson, 2015; Yoon and Lee, 2019), the ongoing doctoral research presented in this talk shifts attention towards the dimensions of distrust and mistrust. Informed by infrastructure studies, it emphasizes the embeddedness of scientific infrastructures within political contexts. The central question revolves around understanding how individuals distinguish between their distrust in a political system and their attitudes towards the infrastructures embedded within that system.~ In the context of (Open) Science infrastructures, the concept of system trust as a notion of trust in socio-technical systems is important. System trust encapsulates the confidence and reliance placed in the overall functionality and dependability of complex systems (Luhmann, 1979; Giddens, 1990; M{\"o}llering, 2001). As users engage with infrastructures, their trust in the system plays a pivotal role in shaping their interactions and decisions. It is conceivable to view trust in public data infrastructures as a manifestation of system trust, reflecting users' confidence in the system's ability to securely and effectively handle information. However, the question arises: can system distrust be theorized when trust in these infrastructures falters or wavers?~ The presented research acknowledges the potential for theorizing system distrust, exploring how the breakdown or uncertainty in trust relations within data infrastructures may give rise to a distinct conceptualization of system distrust. This perspective adds a layer of complexity to our understanding of the interplay between trust, distrust, and the systemic dynamics of public data infrastructures, offering insights into the implications of system trust and its potential fragility within the evolving landscape of scientific practices. An illustrative case study within this research is the Data Rescue movement. In 2016 and 2017, these hackathon-style events aimed to safeguard U.S. federal environmental data, uniting scientists, information professionals, and activists nationwide. Responding to concerns about climate change denial and perceived erosion of environmental protections under the Trump administration, the events were lauded as examples of archival data activism. However, their impact revealed vulnerabilities in federal data infrastructures, particularly in access, amidst budget constraints and staffing reductions. The movement fell short of creating a comprehensive archive, with no endangered data actually deleted. This grassroots activism highlighted the inherently political nature of data management and archiving, emphasizing how mistrust or distrust in public data infrastructures can lead to activities in the realm of data activism. As trust in public data infrastructures is revealed to be susceptible to fluctuations and uncertainties, this research contributes to the study of trust within (open) science by unraveling the implications of system trust in public data infrastructures and its potential fragility. This research not only broadens the scope of (Open) Science discourse but also enriches the field of Science and Technology Studies by highlighting the nuanced dynamics of trust, distrust, and systemic interactions within public data infrastructures. The insights garnered from this exploration contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the relationships shaping scientific practices, emphasizing the need for a holistic approach that embraces the complexities of trust in socio-technical systems.},
