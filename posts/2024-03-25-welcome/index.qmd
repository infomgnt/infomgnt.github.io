Welcome! This is the first post in our new group blog [^1]. We, the Information Management group at Humboldt University's Berlin School of Library and Information Science, explore the role of digital research and information infrastructures in science within the context of digital transformation.

The focus of our research is on information infrastructures that enable the collection, indexing, accessibility, and re-use of information objects for the purpose of Open Science.

Our work considers processes of digital scholarly communication and related practices, standards, and policies. These aspects are addressed from the perspective of information and library science, with a focus on libraries, computing centers, and other service facilities supporting research at scientific organizations.

Current topics of the research and teaching group include:

-   Information infrastructures for Open Science

-   Research data management

-   Open Access and developments in digital scholarly communication

-   Research software and digital services for information and knowledge production

-   Management of research information

-   Science policy and Open Science

-   Academic libraries in the context of changing information and knowledge practices

Further information about our work can be found on our official website: <http://hu.berlin/infomgnt>
