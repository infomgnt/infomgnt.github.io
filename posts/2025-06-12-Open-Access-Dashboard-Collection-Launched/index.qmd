# Open Access Dashboard Collection Launched

As Open Access becomes increasingly central to scholarship and science policy, understanding the proportion of open publications within the overall publication output, whether at the level of research-performing organizations, individual countries, or globally, is gaining importance.

In recent years, an increasing number of dashboards have been created to track different facets of Open Access. Yet, a comprehensive overview of these tools has been missing. In our project [OA Datenpraxis](https://oa-datenpraxis.de/en/) (Data Practice for Shaping the Open Access Transformation – Analysis, Recommendation, Training & Networking), funded by the [German Research Foundation (DFG)](https://www.dfg.de/) [@pampel_datenpraxis_2024], we have spent the past several months engaging with this topic by systematically mapping and analyzing the current landscape of Open Access dashboards.

We conducted a survey in which we identified nearly 60 dashboards. To enable a structured description of these dashboards, we developed a dedicated [metadata schema](https://oa-datenpraxis.de/dashboards_schema.html). This schema captures key characteristics such as data sources, their license, responsible organizations, the type of output they monitor and more.

The resulting [Open Access Dashboard Collection](https://oa-datenpraxis.de/en/dashboard_uebersicht.html) is now available on the project website. The underlying [metadata schema](https://oa-datenpraxis.de/dashboards_schema.html) is also accessible there and open for reuse.

We aim to continue developing this dataset through an open and participatory process. We welcome suggestions for additional dashboards as well as ideas for further refining the dataset and its structure.

An editable version of the collection is available in a [shared Nextcloud folder](https://nextcloud.gfz.de/s/QG38J6kEDbJ8DXz), where you can directly add your suggestions. For questions, feedback, or submissions, please contact us at: [oa-datenpraxis-dashboards\@listserv.dfn.de](mailto:oa-datenpraxis-dashboards@listserv.dfn.de). We look forward to hearing from you!

The project OA Datenpraxis supports the development of infrastructures for the open access transformation at research institutions in Germany. It focuses on promoting and establishing sovereign data practices to shape and manage this transformation effectively.
