We are excited to announce the launch of our new project, "Data Practices for Shaping Open Access Transformation - Analysis, Recommendation, Training & Networking - OA Datenpraxis" funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation).
Together with our colleagues at the [Helmholtz Open Science Office](https://os.helmholtz.de/) and the [Scholarly Communication Analytics Team](https://subugoe.github.io/scholcomm_analytics/) at the [Lower Saxony State and University Library Göttingen](https://www.sub.uni-goettingen.de/sub-aktuell/) (SUB), we, the research group Information Management at the [Berlin School of Library and Information Science](https://www.ibi.hu-berlin.de/en/about-us) (IBI), will work towards strengthening structures for the use of data on the open access transformation at research institutions in Germany.      

The project supports practitioners in research administration, libraries and other service institutions in professionalizing their data practices through various activities. As a first step, the team at IBI will conduct a comprehensive study on how research institutions handle publication costs. Our research will build on existing research and previous work of the project partners. Our goal is to get a better understanding of current practices and challenges associated with managing data on Open Access publications and associated costs.
In strengthening the abilities of research institutions to leverage data to monitor publication output and associated costs, we are addressing some of the recommendations of the German Council of Science and Humanities for fostering the Open Access transformation in Germany [Wissenschaftsrat, 2022]. Additional information about the project and its goals can be found in the project proposal (in German) [Pampel et al., 2024].      
At this year's Open-Access-Tage in Cologne, we are organizing a workshop with [Open-Access-Büro Berlin](https://www.open-access-berlin.de), [Vernetzungs- und Kompetenzstelle Open Access Brandenburg](https://open-access-brandenburg.de) and [Open Access Monitor](https://open-access-monitor.de) at Forschungszentrum Jülich (FZJ). If you are interested in Open Access reporting and are attending, please feel free to approach us at the conference, or contact us via [email](info.oa-datenpraxis@listserv.dfn.de).

We will report on current activities and project outputs on the [project website](https://oa-datenpraxis.de) and [Mastodon account](https://openbiblio.social/@oa_datenpraxis).
