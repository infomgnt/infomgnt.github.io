In April, two members of our research group were featured in interviews:

Dorothea Strecker, who has been studying shadow libraries for many years, was interviewed by the Norwegian newspaper Klassekampen [@stormyren_larsen_disse_2025]. The interview was prompted by the investigation “The Unbelievable Scale of AI’s Pirated-Books Problem” published in The Atlantic [@reisner_unbelievable_2025].

Heinz Pampel was interviewed for the \@mediasres program on Deutschlandfunk [@deutschlandfunkde_eigene_2025]. The topic was the AI strategies of academic publishers. The interview was triggered by Politico's announcement of a Policy Intelligence Assistant [@cooke_politico_2025]. We’re pleased about the interest in our research!
